    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      No less an event than Alfred&rsquo;s marriage, no event calling less
      imperatively upon her feelings, could have recovered Lady Jane&rsquo;s sympathy
      for Caroline. But Alfred Percy, who had been the restorer of her fortune,
      her friend in adversity, what pain it would give him to find her, at the
      moment when he might expect her congratulations, quarrelling with his
      sister&mdash;that sister, too, who had left her home, where she was so
      happy, and Hungerford Castle, where she was adored, on purpose to tend
      Lady Jane in sickness and obscurity!
    </p>
    <p>
      Without being put exactly into these words, or, perhaps, into any words,
      thoughts such as these, with feelings of gratitude and affection, revived
      for Caroline in Lady Jane&rsquo;s mind the moment she heard of Alfred&rsquo;s intended
      marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good young man!&mdash;Excellent friend!&mdash;Well, tell me all about it,
      <i>my dear</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time that her ladyship had said <i>my dear</i> to
      Caroline since the day of the fatal refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline was touched by this word of reconciliation&mdash;and the tears it
      brought into her eyes completely overcame Lady Jane, who hastily wiped her
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, my dear Caroline&mdash;where were we? Tell me about your brother&rsquo;s
      marriage&mdash;when is it to be?&mdash;How has it been brought about?&mdash;The
      last I heard of the Leicesters was the good dean&rsquo;s death&mdash;I remember
      pitying them very much&mdash;Were they not left in straitened
      circumstances, too? Will Alfred have any fortune with Miss Leicester?&mdash;Tell
      me every thing&mdash;read me his letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To go back to Dr. Leicester&rsquo;s death. For some months his preferments were
      kept in abeyance. Many were named, or thought of, as likely to succeed
      him. The deanery was in the gift of the crown, and as it was imagined that
      the vicarage was also at the disposal of government, applications had
      poured in, on all sides, for friends, and friends&rsquo; friends, to the
      remotest link of the supporters of ministry&mdash;But&mdash;to use their
      own elegant, phrase&mdash;the hands of government were tied.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that in consequence of some parliamentary interest, formerly
      given opportunely, and in consideration of certain arrangements in his
      diocese, to serve persons whom ministers were obliged to oblige, a promise
      had long ago been given to Bishop Clay that his recommendation to the
      deanery should be accepted on the next vacancy. The bishop, who had
      promised the living to his sister&rsquo;s husband, now presented it to Mr.
      Buckhurst Falconer, with the important addition of Dr. Leicester&rsquo;s
      deanery.
    </p>
    <p>
      To become a dean was once the height of Buckhurst&rsquo;s ambition, that for
      which in a moment of elation he prayed, scarcely hoping that his wishes
      would ever be fulfilled: yet now that his wish was accomplished, and that
      he had attained this height of his ambition, was he happy? No!&mdash;far
      from it; farther than ever. How could he be happy&mdash;dissatisfied with
      his conduct, and detesting his wife? In the very act of selling himself to
      this beldam, he abhorred his own meanness; but he did not know how much
      reason he should have to repent, till the deed was done. It was done in a
      hurry, with all the precipitation of a man who hates himself for what he
      feels forced to do. Unused to bargain and sale in any way, in marriage
      never having thought of it before, Buckhurst did not take all precautions
      necessary to make his sacrifice answer his own purpose. He could not
      conceive the avaricious temper and habits of his lady, till he was hers
      past redemption. Whatever accession of income he obtained from his
      marriage, he lived up to; immediately, his establishment, his expenses,
      surpassed his revenue. His wife would not pay or advance a shilling beyond
      her stipulated quota to their domestic expenses. He could not hear the
      parsimonious manner in which she would have had him live, or the shabby
      style in which she received his friends. He was more profuse in proportion
      as she was more niggardly; and whilst she scolded and grudged every penny
      she paid, he ran in debt magnanimously for hundreds. When the living and
      deanery came into his possession, the second year&rsquo;s fruits had been eaten
      beforehand. Money he must have, and money his wife would not give&mdash;but
      a litigious agent suggested to him a plan for raising it, by demanding a
      considerable sum from the executors of the late Dr. Leicester, for what is
      called <i>dilapidation</i>. The parsonage-house seemed to be in good
      repair; but to make out charges of dilapidation was not difficult to those
      who understood the business&mdash;and fifteen hundred pounds was the
      charge presently made out against the executors of the late incumbent. It
      was invidious, it was odious for the new vicar, in the face of his
      parishioners, of all those who loved and respected his predecessor, to
      begin by making such a demand&mdash;especially as it was well known that
      the late dean had not saved any of the income of his preferment, but had
      disposed of it amongst his parishioners as a steward for the poor. He had
      left his family in narrow circumstances. They were proud of his virtues,
      and not ashamed of the consequences. With dignity and ease they retrenched
      their expenses; and after having lived as became the family of a dignitary
      of the church, on quitting the parsonage, the widow and her niece retired
      to a small habitation, suited to their altered circumstances, and lived
      with respectable and respected economy. The charge brought against them by
      the new dean was an unexpected blow. It was an extortion, to which Mrs.
      Leicester would not submit&mdash;could not without injury to her niece,
      from whose fortune the sum claimed, if yielded, must be deducted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred Percy, from the first moment of their distress, from the time of
      good Dr. Leicester&rsquo;s death, had been assiduous in his attentions to Mrs.
      Leicester; and by the most affectionate letters, and, whenever he could
      get away from London, by his visits to her and to his Sophia, had proved
      the warmth and constancy of his attachment. Some months had now passed&mdash;he
      urged his suit, and besought Sophia no longer to delay his happiness. Mrs.
      Leicester wished that her niece should now give herself a protector and
      friend, who might console her for the uncle she had lost. It was at this
      period the <i>dilapidation charge</i> was made. Mrs. Leicester laid the
      whole statement before Alfred, declaring that for his sake, as well as for
      her niece&rsquo;s, she was resolute to defend herself against injustice. Alfred
      could scarcely bring himself to believe that Buckhurst Falconer had acted
      in the manner represented, with a rapacity, harshness, and cruelty, so
      opposite to his natural disposition. Faults, Alfred well knew that
      Buckhurst had; but they were all, he thought, of quite a different sort
      from those of which he now stood accused. What was to be done? Alfred was
      extremely averse from going to law with a man who was his relation, for
      whom he had early felt, and still retained, a considerable regard: yet he
      could not stand by, and see the woman he loved, defrauded of nearly half
      the small fortune she possessed. On the other hand, he was employed as a
      professional man, and called upon to act. He determined, however, before
      he should, as a last resource, expose the truth and maintain the right in
      a court of justice, previously to try every means of conciliation in his
      power. To all his letters the new dean answered evasively and
      unsatisfactorily, by referring him to his attorney, into whose hands he
      said he had put the business, and he knew and wished to hear nothing more
      about it. The attorney, Solicitor Sharpe, was impracticable&mdash;Alfred
      resolved to see the dean himself; and this, after much difficulty, he at
      length effected. He found the dean and his lady tête-à-tête. Their raised
      voices suddenly stopped short as he entered. The dean gave an angry look
      at his servant as Alfred came into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your servants,&rdquo; said Alfred, &ldquo;told me that you were not at home, but I
      told them that I knew the dean would be at home to an old friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good,&mdash;(said Buckhurst)&mdash;you do me a great deal of
      honour,&rdquo; said the dean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two different manners appeared in the same person: one natural&mdash;belonging
      to his former, the other assumed, proper, as he thought, for his present
      self, or rather for his present situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you be seated? I hope all our friends&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Buckhurst, or,
      as she was called, Mrs. Dean Falconer, made divers motions, with a very
      ugly chin, and stood as if she thought there ought to be an introduction.
      The dean knew it, but being ashamed to introduce her, determined against
      it. Alfred stood in suspension, waiting their mutual pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down, sir?&rdquo; repeated the dean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down plumped Mrs. Falconer directly, and taking out her spectacles, as if
      to shame her husband, by heightening the contrast of youth and age,
      deliberately put them on; then drawing her table nearer, settled herself
      to her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred, who saw it to be necessary, determined to use his best address to
      conciliate the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dean, you have never yet done me the honour to introduce me to Mrs.
      Falconer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought&mdash;I thought we had met before&mdash;since&mdash;Mrs.
      Falconer, Mr. Alfred Percy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady took off her spectacles, smiled, and adjusted herself, evidently
      with an intention to be more agreeable. Alfred sat down by her work-table,
      directed his conversation to her, and soon talked, or rather induced her
      to talk herself into fine humour. Presently she retired to dress for
      dinner, and &ldquo;hoped Mr. Alfred Percy had no intention of running away&mdash;<i>she</i>
      had a well-aired bed to offer him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dean, though he cordially hated his lady, was glad, for his own sake,
      to be relieved from her fits of crossness; and was pleased by Alfred&rsquo;s
      paying attention to her, as this was a sort of respect to himself, and
      what he seldom met with from those young men who had been his companions
      before his marriage&mdash;they usually treated his lady with a neglect or
      ridicule which reflected certainly upon her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred never yet had touched upon his business, and Buckhurst began to
      think this was merely a friendly visit. Upon Alfred&rsquo;s observing some
      alteration which had been lately made in the room in which they were
      sitting, the dean took him to see other improvements in the house; in
      pointing out these, and all the conveniences and elegancies about the
      parsonage, Buckhurst totally forgot the <i>dilapidation suit</i>; and
      every thing he showed and said tended unawares to prove that the house was
      in the most perfect repair and best condition possible. Gradually,
      whatever solemnity and beneficed pomp there had at first appeared in the
      dean&rsquo;s manner, wore off, or was laid aside; and, except his being somewhat
      more corpulent and rubicund than in early years, he appeared like the
      original Buckhurst. His gaiety of heart, indeed, was gone, but some
      sparkles of his former spirits remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said he, showing Alfred into his study, &ldquo;here, as our good friend
      Mr. <i>Blank</i> said, when he showed us his study, &lsquo;<i>Here</i> is <i>where</i>
      I read all day long&mdash;quite snug&mdash;and nobody&rsquo;s a bit the wiser
      for it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dean seated himself in his comfortable arm-chair. &ldquo;Try that chair,
      Alfred, excellent for sleeping in at one&rsquo;s ease.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;To rest the cushion and soft dean invite.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Alfred, &ldquo;often have I sat in this room with my excellent
      friend, Dr. Leicester!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The new dean&rsquo;s countenance suddenly changed: but endeavouring to pass it
      off with a jest, he said, &ldquo;Ay, poor good old Leicester, he sleeps for
      ever,&mdash;that&rsquo;s one comfort&mdash;to me&mdash;if not to you.&rdquo; But
      perceiving that Alfred continued to look serious, the dean added some more
      proper reflections in a tone of ecclesiastical sentiment, and with a sigh
      of decorum&mdash;then rose, for he smelt that the <i>dilapidation suit</i>
      was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would not you like, Mr. Percy, to wash your hands before dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Mr. Dean, I must detain you a moment to speak to you on
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Black as Erebus grew the face of the dean&mdash;he had no resource but to
      listen, for he knew it would come after dinner, if it did not come now;
      and it was as well to have it alone in the study, where nobody might be a
      bit the wiser.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Alfred had stated the whole of what he had to say, which he did in as
      few and strong words as possible, appealing to the justice and feelings of
      Buckhurst&mdash;to the fears which the dean must have of being exposed,
      and ultimately defeated, in a court of justice&mdash;&ldquo;Mrs. Leicester,&rdquo;
       concluded he, &ldquo;is determined to maintain the suit, and has employed me to
      carry it on for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should very little have expected,&rdquo; said the dean, &ldquo;that Mr. Alfred
      Percy would have been employed in such a way against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still less should I have expected that I could be called upon in such a
      way against you,&rdquo; replied Alfred. &ldquo;No one can feel it more than I do. The
      object of my present visit is to try whether some accommodation may not be
      made, which will relieve us both from the necessity of going to law, and
      may prevent me from being driven to the performance of this most painful
      professional duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duty! professional duty!&rdquo; repeated Buckhurst: &ldquo;as if I did not understand
      all those <i>cloak-words</i>, and know how easy it is to put them on and
      off at pleasure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To some it may be, but not to me,&rdquo; said Alfred, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anger started into Buckhurst&rsquo;s countenance: but conscious how
      inefficacious it would be, and how completely he had laid himself open,
      the dean answered, &ldquo;You are the best judge, sir. But I trust&mdash;though
      I don&rsquo;t pretend to understand the honour of lawyers&mdash;I trust, as a
      gentleman, you will not take advantage against me in this suit, of any
      thing my openness has shown you about the parsonage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You trust rightly, Mr. Dean,&rdquo; replied Alfred, in his turn, with a look
      not of anger, but of proud indignation; &ldquo;you trust rightly, Mr. Dean, and
      as I should have expected that one who has had opportunities of knowing me
      so well ought to trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a clear answer,&rdquo; said Buckhurst. &ldquo;But how could I tell?&mdash;so
      much <i>jockeying</i> goes on in every profession&mdash;how could I tell
      that a lawyer would be more conscientious than another man? But now you
      assure me of it&mdash;I take it upon your word, and believe it in your
      case. About the accommodation&mdash;<i>accommodation</i> means money, does
      not it?&mdash;frankly, I have not a shilling. But Mrs. Falconer is all <i>accommodation</i>.
      Try what you can do with her&mdash;and by the way you began, I should hope
      you would do a great deal,&rdquo; added he, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred would not undertake to speak to his lady, unless the dean would, in
      the first instance, make some sacrifice. He represented that he was not
      asking for money, but for a relinquishment of a claim, which he
      apprehended not to be justly due: &ldquo;And the only use I shall ever make of
      what you have shown me here, is to press upon your feelings, as I do at
      this moment, the conviction of the injustice of that claim, which I am
      persuaded your lawyers only instigated, and that you will abandon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buckhurst begged him not to be persuaded of any such thing. The
      instigation of an attorney, he laughing said, was not in law counted the
      instigation of the devil&mdash;at law no man talked of feelings. In
      matters of property judges did not understand them, whatever figure they
      might make with a jury in criminal cases&mdash;with an eloquent advocate&rsquo;s
      hand on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred let Buckhurst go on with his vain wit and gay rhetoric till he had
      nothing more to say, knowing that he was hiding consciousness of
      unhandsome conduct. Sticking firmly to his point, Alfred showed that his
      client, though gentle, was resolved, and that, unless Buckhurst yielded,
      law must take its course&mdash;that though he should never give any hint,
      the premises must be inspected, and disgrace and defeat must follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forced to be serious, fretted and hurried, for the half-hour bell before
      dinner had now rung, and the dean&rsquo;s stomach began to know canonical hours,
      he exclaimed, &ldquo;The upshot of the whole business is, that Mr. Alfred Percy
      is in love, I understand, with Miss Sophia Leicester, and this fifteen
      hundred pounds, which he pushes me to the bare wall to relinquish, is
      eventually, as part of her fortune, to become his. Would it not have been
      as fair to have stated this at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;because it would not have been the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&mdash;You won&rsquo;t deny that you are in love with Miss Leicester?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am as much in love as man can be with Miss Leicester; but her fortune
      is nothing to me, for I shall never touch it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never touch it! Does the aunt&mdash;the widow&mdash;the cunning widow,
      refuse consent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far from it: the aunt is all the aunt of Miss Leicester should be&mdash;all
      the widow of Dr. Leicester ought to be. But her circumstances are not what
      they ought to be; and by the liberality of a friend, who lends me a house,
      rent free, and by the resources of my profession, I am better able than
      Mrs. Leicester is to spare fifteen hundred pounds: therefore, in the
      recovery of this money I have no personal interest at present. I shall
      never receive it from her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noble! Noble!&mdash;just what I could have done myself&mdash;once! What a
      contrast!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buckhurst laid his head down upon his arms flat on the table, and remained
      for some moments silent&mdash;then, starting upright, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never claim a
      penny from her&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give it all up to you! I will, if I sell my band
      for it, by Jove!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what has your father to answer for, who forced you into the church!&rdquo;
       thought Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Buckhurst,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my dear dean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me Buckhurst, if you love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do love you, it is impossible to help it, in spite of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All my faults&mdash;say it out&mdash;say it out&mdash;in spite of your
      conscience,&rdquo; added Buckhurst, trying to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in spite of my conscience, but in favour of yours,&rdquo; said Alfred,
      &ldquo;against whose better dictates you have been compelled all your life to
      act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have so, but that&rsquo;s over. What remains to be done at present? I am in
      real distress for five hundred pounds. Apropos to your being engaged in
      this dilapidation suit, you can speak to Mrs. Falconer about it. Tell her
      I have given up the thing; and see what she will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred promised he would speak to Mrs. Falconer. &ldquo;And, Alfred, when you
      see your sister Caroline, tell her that I am not in one sense such a
      wretch&mdash;quite, as she thinks me. But tell her that I am yet a greater
      wretch&mdash;infinitely more miserable than she, I hope, can conceive&mdash;beyond
      redemption&mdash;beyond endurance miserable.&rdquo; He turned away hastily in an
      agony of mind. Alfred shut the door and escaped, scarcely able to bear
      his own emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they met at dinner, Mrs. Dean Falconer was an altered person&mdash;her
      unseemly morning costume and well-worn shawl being cast aside, she
      appeared in bloom-coloured gossamer gauze, and primrose ribbons, a
      would-be young lady. Nothing of that curmudgeon look, or old fairy cast of
      face and figure, to which he had that morning been introduced, but in
      their place smiles, and all the false brilliancy which rouge can give to
      the eyes, proclaimed a determination to be charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dean was silent, and scarcely ate any thing, though the dinner was
      excellent, for his lady was skilled in the culinary department, and in
      favour of Alfred had made a more hospitable display than she usually
      condescended to make for her husband&rsquo;s friends. There were no other
      guests, except a young lady, companion to Mrs. Falconer. Alfred was as
      agreeable and entertaining as circumstances permitted; and Mrs. Buckhurst
      Falconer, as soon as she got out of the dining-room, even before she
      reached the drawing-room, pronounced him to be a most polite and
      accomplished young man, very different indeed from the <i>common run</i>,
      or the usual style, of Mr. Dean Falconer&rsquo;s dashing bachelor beaux, who in
      her opinion were little better than brute bears.
    </p>
    <p>
      At coffee, when the gentlemen joined the ladies in the drawing-room, as
      Alfred was standing beside Mrs. Falconer, meditating how and when to speak
      of the object of his visit, she cleared the ground by choosing the topic
      of conversation, which, at last fairly drove her husband out of the room.
      She judiciously, maliciously, or accidentally, began to talk of the
      proposal which she had heard a near relation of hers had not long since
      made to a near relation of Mr. Alfred Percy&rsquo;s&mdash;Mr. Clay, of
      Clay-hall, her nephew, had proposed for Mr. Alfred&rsquo;s sister, Miss Caroline
      Percy. She was really sorry the match was not to take place, for she had
      heard a very high character of the young lady in every way, and her nephew
      was rich enough to do without fortune&mdash;not but what that would be
      very acceptable to all men&mdash;especially young men, who are now mostly
      all for money instead of all for love&mdash;except in the case of very
      first rate extraordinary beauty, which therefore making a woman a prey,
      just as much one as the other, might be deemed a misfortune as great,
      though hardly <i>quite</i>, Mrs. Buckhurst said, as she had found a great
      fortune in her own particular case. The involution of meaning in these
      sentences rendering it not easy to be comprehended, the dean stood it
      pretty well, only stirring his coffee, and observing that it was cold; but
      when his lady went on to a string of interrogatories about Miss Caroline
      Percy&mdash;on the colour of her eyes and hair&mdash;size of her mouth and
      nose&mdash;requiring in short a complete full-length portrait of the young
      lady, poor Buckhurst set down his cup, and pleading business in his study,
      left the field open to Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Near-sighted glasses! Do you never use them, Mr. Percy?&rdquo; said Mrs. Dean
      Falconer, as she thought Alfred&rsquo;s eyes fixed upon her spectacles, which
      lay on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      No&mdash;he never used them, he thanked her: he was rather far-sighted
      than short-sighted. She internally commended his politeness in not taking
      them up to verify her assertion, and put them into her pocket to avoid all
      future danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw it was a favourable moment, and entered at once into his business&mdash;beginning
      by observing that the dean was much out of spirits. The moment money was
      touched upon, the curmudgeon look returned upon the lady; and for some
      time Alfred had great difficulty in making himself heard: she poured forth
      such complaints against the extravagance of the dean, with lists of the
      debts she had paid, the sums she had given, and the vow she had made,
      never to go beyond the weekly allowance she had, at the last settlement,
      agreed to give her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred pleaded strongly the expense of law, and the certainty, in his
      opinion, of ultimate defeat, with the being obliged to pay all the costs,
      which would fall upon the dean. The dean was willing to withdraw his claim&mdash;he
      had promised to do so, in the most handsome manner; and therefore, Alfred
      said, he felt particularly anxious that he should not be distressed for
      five hundred pounds, a sum for which he knew Mr. Falconer was immediately
      pressed. He appealed to Mrs. Falconer&rsquo;s generosity. He had been desired by
      the dean to speak to her on the subject, otherwise he should not have
      presumed&mdash;and it was as a professional man, and a near relation, that
      he now took the liberty: this was the first transaction he had ever had
      with her, and he hoped he should leave the vicarage impressed with a sense
      of her generosity, and enabled to do her justice in the opinion of those
      who did not know her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was very little to her, she bluntly said&mdash;she acted only up to
      her own notions&mdash;she lived only for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for her husband.&rdquo; Love, Alfred Percy said, he was assured, was
      superior to money in her opinion. &ldquo;And after all, my dear madam, you set
      me the example of frankness, and permit me to speak to you without
      reserve. What can you, who have no reason, you say, to be pleased with
      either of your nephews, do better with your money, than spend it while you
      live and for yourself, in securing happiness in the gratitude and
      affection of a husband, who, generous himself, will be peculiarly touched
      and attached by generosity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words, <i>love, generosity, generous</i>, sounded upon the lady&rsquo;s ear,
      and she was unwilling to lose that high opinion which she imagined Alfred
      entertained of her sentiments and character. Besides, she was conscious
      that he was in fact nearer the truth than all the world would have
      believed. Avaricious in trifles, and parsimonious in those every-day
      habits which brand the reputation immediately with the fault of avarice,
      this woman was one of those misers who can be generous by fits and starts,
      and who have been known to <i>give</i> hundreds of pounds, but never
      without reluctance would part with a shilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      She presented the dean, her husband, with an order on her banker for the
      money he wanted, and Alfred had the pleasure of leaving his unhappy friend
      better, at least, than he found him. He rejoiced in having compromised
      this business so successfully, and in thus having prevented the
      litigation, ill-will, and disgraceful circumstances, which, without his
      interference, must have ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gratitude of Mrs. Leicester and her niece was delightful. The aunt
      urged him to accept what he had been the means of saving, as part of her
      niece&rsquo;s fortune; but this he absolutely refused, and satisfied Mrs.
      Leicester&rsquo;s delicacy, by explaining, that he could not, if he would, now
      yield to her entreaties, as he had actually obtained the money from poor
      Buckhurst&rsquo;s generous repentance, upon the express faith that he had no
      private interest in the accommodation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not,&rdquo; said Alfred, &ldquo;bring me under the act against raising
      money upon false pretences?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What Alfred lost in money he gained in love. His Sophia&rsquo;s eyes beamed upon
      him with delight. The day was fixed for their marriage, and at Alfred&rsquo;s
      suggestion, Mrs. Leicester consented, painful as it was, in some respects,
      to her feelings, that they should be married by the dean in the parish
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred brought his bride to town, and as soon as they were established in
      their own house, or rather in that house which Mr. Gresham insisted upon
      their calling their own, Lady Jane Granville was the first person to offer
      her congratulations.&mdash;Alfred begged his sister Caroline from Lady
      Jane, as he had already obtained his father&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s consent. Lady
      Jane was really fond of Caroline&rsquo;s company, and had forgiven her, as well
      as she could; yet her ladyship had no longer a hope of being <i>of use</i>
      to her, and felt that even if any other offer were to occur&mdash;and none
      such as had been made could ever more be expected&mdash;it would lead only
      to fresh disappointment and altercation; therefore she, with the less
      reluctance, relinquished Caroline altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline&rsquo;s new sister had been, from the time they were first acquainted,
      her friend, and she rejoiced in seeing all her hopes for her brother&rsquo;s
      happiness accomplished by this marriage. His Sophia had those habits of
      independent occupation which are essential to the wife of a professional
      man, and which enable her to spend cheerfully many hours alone, or at
      least without the company of her husband. On his return home every
      evening, he was sure to find a smiling wife, a sympathizing friend, a
      cheerful fireside.&mdash;She had musical talents&mdash;her husband was
      fond of music; and she did not lay aside the accomplishments which had
      charmed the lover, but made use of them to please him whom she had chosen
      as her companion for life. Her voice, her harp, her utmost skill, were
      ready at any moment, and she found far more delight in devoting her
      talents to him than she had ever felt in exhibiting them to admiring
      auditors. This was the domestic use of accomplishments to which Caroline
      had always been accustomed; so that joining in her new sister&rsquo;s
      occupations and endeavours to make Alfred&rsquo;s evenings pass pleasantly, she
      felt at once as much <i>at home</i> as if she had been in the country; for
      the mind is its own place, and domestic happiness may be naturalized in a
      capital city.
    </p>
    <p>
      At her brother&rsquo;s house, Caroline had an opportunity of seeing a society
      that was new to her, that of the professional men of the first eminence
      both in law and medicine, the men of science and of literature, with whom
      Alfred and Erasmus had been for years assiduously cultivating
      acquaintance. They were now happy to meet at Alfred&rsquo;s house, for they
      liked and esteemed him, and they found his wife and sister sensible,
      well-informed women, to whom their conversation was of real amusement and
      instruction; and who, in return, knew how to enliven their leisure hours
      by female sprightliness and elegance. Caroline now saw the literary and
      scientific world to the best advantage: not the amateurs, or the mere <i>show</i>
      people, but those who, really excelling and feeling their own superiority,
      had too much pride and too little time to waste upon idle flattery, or
      what to them were stupid, uninteresting <i>parties</i>. Those who refused
      to go to Lady Spilsbury&rsquo;s, or to Lady Angelica Headingham&rsquo;s, or who were
      seen there, perhaps, once or twice in a season as a great favour and
      honour, would call three or four evenings every week at Alfred&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first news, the first hints of discoveries, inventions, and literary
      projects, she heard from time to time discussed. Those men of talent, whom
      she had heard were to be seen at <i>conversaziones</i>, or of whom she had
      had a glimpse in fine society, now appeared in a new point of view, and to
      the best advantage; without those pretensions and rivalships with which
      they sometimes are afflicted in public, or those affectations and
      singularities, which they often are supposed to assume, to obtain
      notoriety among persons inferior to them in intellect and superior in
      fashion. Instead of playing, as they sometimes did, a false game to amuse
      the multitude, they were obliged now to exert their real skill, and play
      fair with one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir James Harrington tells us, that in his days the courtiers who played
      at divers games in public, had a way of exciting the admiration and
      amazement of the commoner sort of spectators, by producing heaps of golden
      counters, and seeming to stake immense sums, when all the time they had
      previously agreed among one another, that each guinea should stand for a
      shilling, or each hundred guineas for one: so that in fact two modes of
      calculation were used for the initiated and uninitiated; and this exoteric
      practice goes on continually to this hour, among literary performers in
      the intellectual, as well as among courtiers in the fashionable world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the pleasure of studying celebrated characters, and persons of
      eminent merit, at their ease and at her own, Caroline had now
      opportunities of seeing most of those objects of rational curiosity, which
      with Lady Jane Granville had been prohibited as <i>mauvais ton</i>. With
      men of sense she found it was not <i>mauvais ton</i> to use her eyes for
      the purposes of instruction or entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Mrs. Alfred Percy she saw every thing in the best manner; in the
      company of well-informed guides, who were able to point out what was
      essential to be observed; ready to explain and to illustrate; to procure
      for them all those privileges and advantages as spectators, which common
      gazers are denied, but which liberal and enlightened men are ever not only
      ready to allow, but eager to procure for intelligent, unassuming females.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the gentlemen of learning, talents, and eminence in Alfred&rsquo;s own
      profession, whom Caroline had the honour of seeing at her brother&rsquo;s, were
      Mr. Friend, the <i>friend</i> of his early years at the bar; and that
      great luminary, who in a higher orbit had cheered and guided him in his
      ascent. The chief justice was in a station, and of an age, where praise
      can be conferred without impropriety, and without hurting the feelings of
      delicacy or pride. He knew how to praise&mdash;a difficult art, but he
      excelled in it. As Caroline once, in speaking of him, said, &ldquo;Common
      compliments compared to praise from him, are as common coin compared to a
      medal struck and appropriated for the occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About this time Mr. Temple came to tell Alfred, that a ship had been
      actually ordered to be in readiness to carry him on his intended embassy;
      that Mr. Shaw had recovered; that Cunningham Falconer had no more excuses
      or pretences for delay; despatches, the last Lord Oldborough said he
      should ever receive from him as envoy, had now arrived, and Temple was to
      have set out immediately; but that the whole embassy had been delayed,
      because Lord Oldborough had received a letter from Count Altenberg, giving
      an account of alarming revolutionary symptoms, which had appeared in the
      capital, and in the provinces, in the dominions of his sovereign, Lord
      Oldborough had shown Mr. Temple what related to public affairs, but had
      not put the whole letter into his hands. All that he could judge from what
      he read was, that the Count&rsquo;s mind was most seriously occupied with the
      dangerous state of public affairs in his country. &ldquo;I should have thought,&rdquo;
       added Mr. Temple, &ldquo;that the whole of this communication was entirely of a
      political nature, but that in the last page which Lord Oldborough put into
      my hand, the catch-words at the bottom were <i>Countess Christina</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred observed, &ldquo;that, without the aid of Rosamond&rsquo;s imagination to
      supply something more, nothing could be made of this. However, it was a
      satisfaction to have had direct news of Count Altenberg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day Mr. Temple came for Alfred. Lord Oldborough desired to see
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever his business may be, I am sure it is important and interesting,&rdquo;
       said Mr. Temple; &ldquo;by this time I ought to be well acquainted with Lord
      Oldborough&mdash;I know the signs of his suppressed emotion, and I have
      seldom seen him put such force upon himself to appear calm, and to do the
      business of the day, before he should yield his mind to what pressed on
      his secret thoughts.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Alfred arrived, Lord Oldborough was engaged with some gentlemen from
      the city about a loan. By the length of time which the negotiators stayed,
      they tried Alfred&rsquo;s patience; but the minister sat with immoveable
      composure, till they knew their own minds, and till they departed. Then,
      the loan at once dismissed from his thoughts, he was ready for Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have married, I think, Mr. Alfred Percy, since I saw you last&mdash;I
      congratulate you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lordship was not in the habit of noticing such common events; Alfred
      was surprised and obliged by the interest in his private affairs which
      this congratulation denoted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you, sir, because I understand you have married a woman of
      sense. To marry a fool&mdash;to form or to have any connexion with a
      fool,&rdquo; continued his lordship, his countenance changing remarkably as he
      spoke, &ldquo;I conceive to be the greatest evil, the greatest curse, that can
      be inflicted on a man of sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked across the room with long, firm, indignant strides&mdash;then
      stopping short, he exclaimed, &ldquo;<i>Lettres de cachet</i>!&mdash;Dangerous
      instruments in bad hands!&mdash;As what are not?&mdash;But one good
      purpose they answered&mdash;they put it in the power of the head of every
      noble house to disown, and to deprive of the liberty to disgrace his
      family, any member who should manifest the will to commit desperate crime
      or desperate folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred was by no means disposed to join in praise even of this use of a <i>lettre
      de cachet</i>, but he did not think it a proper time to argue the point,
      as he saw Lord Oldborough was under the influence of some strong passion.
      He waited in silence till his lordship should explain himself farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship unlocked a desk, and produced a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, Mr. Percy&mdash;Mr. Alfred Percy&mdash;have you heard any thing
      lately of the Marchioness of Twickenham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred, at this instant, recollected the whisper which he had once heard
      at chapel, and he added, &ldquo;Not of late, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Lord Oldborough, putting a letter into Alfred&rsquo;s hands&mdash;&ldquo;there
      is the sum of what I have heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter was from the Duke of Greenwich, informing Lord Oldborough that
      an unfortunate discovery had been made of <i>an affair</i> between the
      Marchioness of Twickenham and a certain Captain Bellamy, which rendered an
      immediate separation necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So!&rdquo; thought Alfred, &ldquo;my brother Godfrey had a fine escape of this fair
      lady!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen her once since I received that letter, and I never will see
      her again,&rdquo; said Lord Oldborough: &ldquo;that&rsquo;s past&mdash;all that concerns her
      is past and irremediable. Now as to the future, and to what concerns
      myself. I have been informed&mdash;how truly, I cannot say&mdash;that some
      time ago a rumour, a suspicion of this intrigue was whispered in what they
      call the fashionable world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that your lordship has been truly informed,&rdquo; said Alfred; and
      he then mentioned the whisper he had heard at the chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&mdash;Farther, it has been asserted to me, that a hint was given to
      the Marquis of Twickenham of the danger of suffering that&mdash;what is
      the man&rsquo;s name?&mdash;Bellamy, to be so near his wife; and that the hint
      was disregarded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The marquis did very weakly or very wickedly,&rdquo; said Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All wickedness is weakness, sir, you know: but to our point. I have been
      assured that the actual discovery of the intrigue was made to the marquis
      some months previously to the birth of his child&mdash;and that he forbore
      to take any notice of this, lest it might affect the legitimacy of that
      child. After the birth of the infant&mdash;a boy&mdash;subsequent
      indiscretions on the part of the marchioness, the marquis would make it
      appear, gave rise to his first suspicions. Now, sir, these are the points,
      of which, as my friend, and as a professional man, I desire you to
      ascertain the truth. If the facts are as I have thus heard, I presume no
      divorce can be legally obtained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will direct you instantly to the proper channels for information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Lord Oldborough wrote directions, Alfred assured him he would
      fulfil his commission with all the discretion and celerity in his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next step,&rdquo; continued Lord Oldborough&mdash;&ldquo;for, on such a subject,
      I wish to say all that is necessary at once, that it may be banished from
      my mind&mdash;your next step, supposing the facts to be ascertained, is to
      go with this letter&mdash;my answer to the Duke of Greenwich. See him&mdash;and
      see the marquis. In matters of consequence have nothing to do with
      secondary people&mdash;deal with the principals. Show in the first place,
      as a lawyer, that their divorce is unattainable&mdash;next, show the
      marquis that he destroys his son and heir by attempting it. The duke, I
      believe, would be glad of a pretext for dissolving the political connexion
      between me and the Greenwich family. He fears me, and he fears the world:
      he dares not abandon me without a pretence for the dissolution of
      friendship. He is a weak man, and never dares to act without a pretext;
      but show him that a divorce is not necessary for his purpose&mdash;a
      separation will do as well&mdash;Or without it, I am ready to break with
      him at council, in the House of Lords, on a hundred political points; and
      let him shield himself as he may from the reproach of desertion, by
      leaving the blame of quarrel on my impracticability, or on what he will, I
      care not&mdash;so that my family be saved from the ignominy of divorce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he sealed his letter, Lord Oldborough went on in abrupt sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never counted on a weak man&rsquo;s friendship&mdash;I can do without his
      grace&mdash;Woman! Woman! The same&mdash;ever since the beginning of the
      world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then turning to Alfred to deliver the letter into his hand, &ldquo;Your brother,
      Major Percy, sir&mdash;I think I recollect&mdash;He was better in the West
      Indies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just thinking so, my lord,&rdquo; said Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;better encounter the plague than a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough had never before distinctly adverted to his knowledge of
      his niece&rsquo;s partiality for Godfrey, but his lordship now added, &ldquo;Major
      Percy&rsquo;s honourable conduct is not unknown: I trust honourable conduct
      never was, and never will be, lost upon me.&mdash;This to the Duke of
      Greenwich&mdash;and this to the marquis.&mdash;Since it was to be, I
      rejoice that this Captain Bellamy is the gallant.&mdash;Had it been your
      brother, sir&mdash;could there have been any love in the case&mdash;not,
      observe, that I believe in love, much less am I subject to the weakness of
      remorse&mdash;but a twinge might have seized my mind&mdash;I might
      possibly have been told that the marchioness was married against her
      inclination.&mdash;But I am at ease on that point&mdash;my judgment of her
      was right.&mdash;You will let me know, in one word, the result of your
      negotiation without entering into particulars&mdash;divorce, or no
      divorce, is all I wish to hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred did not know all the circumstances of the Marchioness of
      Twickenham&rsquo;s marriage, nor the peremptory manner in which it had been
      insisted upon by her uncle, otherwise he would have felt still greater
      surprise than that which he now felt, at the stern, unbending character of
      the man. Possessed as Lord Oldborough was by the opinion, that he had at
      the time judged and acted in the best manner possible, no after-events
      could make him doubt the justice of his own decision, or could at all
      shake him in his own estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred soon brought his report. &ldquo;In one word&mdash;no divorce, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s well&mdash;I thank you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lordship made no farther inquiries&mdash;not even whether there was to
      be a <i>separation</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred was commissioned by the Duke of Greenwich to deliver a message,
      which, like the messages of the gods in Homer, he delivered verbatim, and
      without comment: &ldquo;His grace of Greenwich trusts Lord Oldborough will
      believe, that, notwithstanding the unfortunate circumstances, which
      dissolved in some degree the family connexion, it was the farthest
      possible from his grace&rsquo;s wish or thoughts to break with Lord Oldborough,
      as long as private feelings, and public principles, could be rendered by
      any means compatible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough smiled in scorn&mdash;and Alfred could scarcely command
      his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough prepared to give his grace the opportunity, which he knew
      he desired, of differing with him on principle: his lordship thought his
      favour and power were now sufficiently established to be able to do
      without the Duke of Greenwich, and his pride prompted him to show this to
      his grace and to the world. He carried it with a high hand for a short
      time; but even whilst he felt most secure, and when all seemed to bend and
      bow before his genius and his sway, many circumstances and many persons
      were combining to work the downfall of his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the first slight circumstances which shook his favour, was a speech
      he had made to some gentleman, about the presentation of the deanery to
      Buckhurst Falconer. It had been supposed by many, who knew the court which
      Commissioner Falconer paid to Lord Oldborough, that it was through his
      lordship&rsquo;s interest, that this preferment was given to the son; but when
      some person, taking this for granted, spoke of it to his lordship, he
      indignantly disclaimed all part in the transaction, and it is said that he
      added, &ldquo;Sir, I know what is due to private regard as a man&mdash;and as a
      minister what must be yielded to parliamentary influence; but I never
      could have advised the bestowing ecclesiastical benefice and dignity upon
      any one whose conduct was not his first recommendation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech, made in a moment of proud and perhaps unguarded indignation,
      was repeated with additions, suppressions, variations, and comments. Any
      thing will at court serve the purpose of those who wish to injure, and it
      is inconceivable what mischief was done to the minister by this slight
      circumstance. In the first place, the nobleman high in office, and the
      family connexions of the nobleman who had made the exchange of livings,
      and given the promise of the deanery to Bishop Clay, were offended beyond
      redemption&mdash;because they were in the wrong. Then, all who had done,
      or wished to do wrong, in similar instances, were displeased by reflection
      or by anticipation. But Lord Oldborough chiefly was injured by
      misrepresentation in the quarter where it was of most consequence to him
      to preserve his influence. It was construed by the highest authority into
      disrespect, and an imperious desire to encroach on favour, to control
      prerogative, and to subdue the mind of his sovereign. Insidious arts had
      long been secretly employed to infuse these ideas; and when once the
      jealousy of power was excited, every trifle confirmed the suspicion which
      Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s uncourtier-like character was little calculated to
      dispel. His popularity now gave umbrage, and it was hinted that he wished
      to make himself the <i>independent</i> minister of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affairs of the country prospered, however, under his administration;
      there was trouble, there was hazard in change. It was argued, that it was
      best to wait at least for some reverse of fortune in war, or some symptom
      of domestic discontent, before an attempt should be made to displace this
      minister, formidable by his talents, and by the awe his commanding
      character inspired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The habit of confidence and deference for his genius and integrity
      remained, and to him no difference for some time appeared, in consequence
      of the secret decay of favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commissioner Falconer, timid, anxious, restless, was disposed by
      circumstances and by nature, or by second nature, to the vigilance of a
      dependent&rsquo;s life; accustomed to watch and consult daily the barometer of
      court favour, he soon felt the coming storm; and the moment he saw
      prognostics of the change, he trembled, and considered how he should best
      provide for his own safety before the hour of danger arrived. Numerous
      libels against the minister appeared, which Lord Oldborough never read,
      but the commissioner, with his best spectacles, read them all; for he well
      knew and believed what the sage Selden saith, that &ldquo;though some make
      slight of libels, yet you may see by them how the wind sets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After determining by the throwing up of these straws which way the wind
      set, the commissioner began with all possible skill and dexterity to trim
      his boat. But dexterous trimmer though he was, and &ldquo;prescient of change,&rdquo;
       he did yet not foresee from what quarter the storm would come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg&rsquo;s letters had unveiled completely the envoy Cunningham
      Falconer&rsquo;s treachery, as far as it related to his intrigues abroad, and
      other friends detected some of his manoeuvres with politicians at home, to
      whom he had endeavoured to pay court, by betraying confidence reposed in
      him respecting the Tourville papers. Much of the mischief Cunningham had
      done this great minister still operated, unknown to his unsuspicious mind:
      but sufficient was revealed to determine Lord Oldborough to dismiss him
      from all future hopes of his favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Commissioner Falconer,&rdquo; he began one morning, the moment the
      commissioner entered his cabinet, &ldquo;Mr. Commissioner Falconer,&rdquo; in a tone
      which instantly dispelled the smile at entrance from the commissioner&rsquo;s
      countenance, and in the same moment changed his whole configurature. &ldquo;My
      confidence is withdrawn from your son, Mr. Cunningham Falconer&mdash;for
      ever&mdash;and not without good reason&mdash;as you may&mdash;if you are
      not aware of it already&mdash;see, by those papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough turned away, and asked his secretaries for his red box, as
      he was going to council.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he left his cabinet, he looked back, and said, &ldquo;Mr. Falconer, you
      should know, if you be not already apprised of it, that your son
      Cunningham is on his road to Denmark. You should be aware that the journey
      is not made by my desire, or by his majesty&rsquo;s order, or by any official
      authority; consequently he is travelling to the court of Denmark at his
      own expense or yours&mdash;unless he can prevail upon his Grace of
      Greenwich to defray his ambassadorial travelling charges, or can afford to
      wait for them till a total change of administration&mdash;of which, sir,
      if I see any symptoms to-day in council,&rdquo; added his lordship, in the tone
      of bitter irony; &ldquo;I will give you fair notice&mdash;for fair dealing is
      what I practise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This said, the minister left the commissioner to digest his speech as he
      might, and repaired to council, where he found every thing apparently as
      smooth as usual, and where he was received by all, especially by the
      highest, with perfect consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Commissioner Falconer was wretched beyond expression&mdash;wretched
      in the certainty that his son, that he himself, had probably lost,
      irrecoverably, one excellent patron, before they had secured, even in case
      of change, another. This premature discovery of Cunningham&rsquo;s intrigues
      totally disconcerted and overwhelmed him; and, in the bitterness of his
      heart, he cursed the duplicity which he had taught and encouraged, still
      more by example, than by precept. But Cunningham&rsquo;s duplicity had more and
      closer folds than his own. Cunningham, conceited of his diplomatic genius,
      and fearful of the cautious timidity of his father, did not trust that
      father with the knowledge of all he did, or half of what he intended; so
      that the commissioner, who had thought himself at the bottom of every
      thing, now found that he, too, had been cheated by his son with false
      confidences; and was involved by him in the consequences of a scheme, of
      which he had never been the adviser. Commissioner Falconer knew too well,
      by the experience of Cumberland and others, the fate of those who suffer
      themselves to be lured on by second-hand promises; and who venture,
      without being publicly acknowledged by their employers, to undertake any
      diplomatic mission. Nor would Cunningham, whose natural disposition to
      distrust was greater than his father&rsquo;s, have sold himself to any political
      tempter, without first signing and sealing the compact, had he been in
      possession of his cool judgment, and had he been in any other than the
      desperate circumstances in which he was placed. His secret conscience
      whispered that his recall was in consequence of the detection of some of
      his intrigues, and he dreaded to appear before the haughty, irritated
      minister. Deceived also by news from England that Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s
      dismission or resignation could not be distant, Cunningham had ventured
      upon this bold stroke for an embassy.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s return from council, the commissioner, finding, from
      his secret informants, that every thing had gone on smoothly, and being
      over-awed by the confident security of the minister, began to doubt his
      former belief; and, in spite of all the symptoms of change, was now
      inclined to think that none would take place. The sorrow and contrition
      with which he next appeared before Lord Oldborough were, therefore, truly
      sincere; and when he found himself alone once more with his lordship,
      earnest was the vehemence with which he disclaimed his unworthy son, and
      disavowed all knowledge of the transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had seen cause to believe that you had any part in this transaction,
      sir, you would not be here at this moment: therefore your protestations
      are superfluous&mdash;none would be accepted if any were necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The very circumstance of the son&rsquo;s not having trusted the father
      completely, saved the commissioner, for this time, from utter ruin: he
      took breath; and presently&mdash;oh, weak man! doomed never to know how to
      deal with a strong character&mdash;fancying that his intercession might
      avail for his son, and that the pride of Lord Oldborough might be
      appeased, and might be suddenly wrought to forgiveness, by that tone and
      posture of submission and supplication used only by the subject to
      offended majesty, he actually threw himself at the feet of the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gracious lord&mdash;a pardon for my son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beseech you, sir!&rdquo; cried Lord Oldborough, endeavouring to stop him from
      kneeling&mdash;the commissioner sunk instantly on his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never will the unhappy father rise till his son be restored to your
      favour, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Lord Oldborough, &ldquo;I have no favour for those who have no sense
      of honour: rise, Mr. Falconer, and let not the father degrade himself for
      the son&mdash;<i>unavailingly</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The accent and look were decisive&mdash;the commissioner rose. Instead of
      being gratified, his patron seemed shocked, if not disgusted: far from
      being propitiated by this sacrifice of dignity, it rendered him still more
      averse; and no consolatory omen appearing, the commissioner withdrew in
      silence, repenting that he had abased himself. After this, some days and
      nights passed with him in all the horrors of indecision&mdash;Could the
      minister weather the storm or not?&mdash;should Mr. Falconer endeavour to
      reinstate himself with Lord Oldborough, or secure in time favour with the
      Duke of Greenwich?&mdash;Mrs. Falconer, to whom her husband&rsquo;s groans in
      the middle of the night at last betrayed the sufferings of his mind, drew
      from him the secret of his fears and meditations. She advised strongly the
      going over, decidedly, and in time, but secretly, to the Greenwich
      faction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner knew that this could not be done secretly. The attention
      of the minister was now awake to all his motions, and the smallest
      movement towards his grace of Greenwich must be observed and understood.
      On the other hand, to abide by a falling minister was folly, especially
      when he had positively withdrawn his favour from Cunningham, who had the
      most to expect from his patronage. Between these opposite difficulties,
      notwithstanding the urgent excitations of Mrs. Falconer, the poor
      commissioner could not bring himself to decide, till the time for action
      was past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another blow came upon him for which he was wholly unprepared&mdash;there
      arrived from abroad accounts of the failure of a secret expedition; and
      the general in his despatches named Colonel John Falconer as the officer
      to whose neglect of orders he principally attributed the disappointment.
      It appeared that orders had been sent to have his regiment at a certain
      place at a given hour. At the moment these orders came, Colonel John
      Falconer was out on a shooting party without leave. The troops, of course,
      on which the general had relied, did not arrive in time, and all his other
      combinations failed from this neglect of discipline and disobedience of
      orders. Colonel Falconer was sent home to be tried by a court-martial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pity you, sir,&rdquo; said Lord Oldborough, as Commissioner Falconer, white
      as ashes, read in his presence these despatches&mdash;&ldquo;I pity you, sir,
      from my soul: here is no fault of yours&mdash;the fault is mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was one of the few faults of this nature which Lord Oldborough had ever
      committed. Except in the instance of the Falconer family, none could name
      any whom his lordship had placed in situations, for which they were
      inadequate or unfit. Of this single error he had not foreseen the
      consequences; they were more important, more injurious to him and to the
      public, than he could have calculated or conceived. It appeared now as if
      the Falconer family were doomed to be his ruin. That the public knew, in
      general, that John Falconer had been promoted by ministerial favour, Lord
      Oldborough was aware; but he imagined that the peculiar circumstances of
      that affair were known only to himself and to Commissioner Falconer&rsquo;s
      family. To his astonishment he found, at this critical moment, that the
      whole transaction had reached the ear of majesty, and that it was soon
      publicly known. The commissioner, with protestations and oaths, declared
      that the secret had never, by his means, transpired&mdash;it had been
      divulged by the baseness of his son Cunningham, who betrayed it to the
      Greenwich faction. They, skilled in all the arts of undermining a rival,
      employed the means that were thus put into their power with great
      diligence and effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was observed at the levee, that the sovereign looked coldly upon the
      minister. Every courtier whispered that Lord Oldborough had been certainly
      much to blame. Disdainful of their opinions, Lord Oldborough was sensibly
      affected by the altered eye of his sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! After all my services!&mdash;At the first change of fortune!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sentiment swelled in his breast; but his countenance was rigidly
      calm, his demeanour towards the courtiers and towards his colleagues more
      than usually firm, if not haughty.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the levee, he demanded a private audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone with the king, the habitual influence of this great minister&rsquo;s
      superior genius operated. The cold manner was changed, or rather, it was
      changed involuntarily. From one &ldquo;not used to the language of apology,&rdquo; the
      frank avowal of a fault has a striking effect. Lord Oldborough took upon
      himself the whole blame of the disaster that had ensued, in consequence of
      his error, an error frequent in other ministers, in him, almost
      unprecedented.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was answered with a smile of royal raillery, that the peculiar family
      circumstances which had determined his lordship so rapidly to promote that
      officer, must, to all fathers of families and heads of houses, if not to
      statesmen and generals, be a sufficient and home apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering the peculiar talent which his sovereign possessed, and in
      which he gloried, that of knowing the connexions and domestic affairs, not
      only of the nobility near his person, but of private individuals remote
      from his court, Lord Oldborough had little cause to be surprised that this
      secret transaction should be known to his majesty. Something of this his
      lordship, with all due respect, hinted in reply. At the termination of
      this audience, he was soothed by the condescending assurance, that whilst
      the circumstances of the late unfortunate reverse naturally created regret
      and mortification, no dissatisfaction with his ministerial conduct mixed
      with these feelings; on the contrary, he was assured that fear of the
      effect a disappointment might have on the mind of the public, in
      diminishing confidence in his lordship&rsquo;s efforts for the good of the
      country, was the sentiment which had lowered the spirits and clouded the
      brow of majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship returned thanks for the gracious demonstration of these
      sentiments&mdash;and, bowing respectfully, withdrew. In the faces and
      behaviour of the courtiers, as in a glass, he saw reflected the truth.
      They all pretended to be in the utmost consternation; and he heard of
      nothing but &ldquo;apprehensions for the effect on the public mind,&rdquo; and &ldquo;fears
      for his lordship&rsquo;s popularity.&rdquo; His secretary, Mr. Temple, heard, indeed,
      more of this than could reach his lordship&rsquo;s ear directly; for, even now,
      when they thought they foresaw his fall, few had sufficient courage to
      hazard the tone of condolence with Lord Oldborough, or to expose the face
      of hypocrisy to the severity of his penetrating eye. In secret, every
      means had been taken to propagate in the city, the knowledge of all the
      circumstances that were unfavourable to the minister, and to increase the
      dissatisfaction which any check in the success of our armies naturally
      produces. The tide of popularity, which had hitherto supported the
      minister, suddenly ebbed; and he fell, in public opinion, with astonishing
      rapidity. For the moment all was forgotten, but that he was the person who
      had promoted John Falconer to be a colonel, against whom the cry of the
      populace was raised with all the clamour of national indignation. The
      Greenwich faction knew how to take advantage of this disposition. It
      happened to be some festival, some holiday, when the common people, having
      nothing to do, are more disposed than at any other time to intoxication
      and disorder. The emissaries of designing partisans mixed with the
      populace, and a mob gathered round the minister&rsquo;s carriage, as he was
      returning home late one day&mdash;the same carriage, and the same man,
      whom, but a few short weeks before, this populace had drawn with loud
      huzzas, and almost with tears of affection. Unmoved of mind, as he had
      been when he heard their huzzas, Lord Oldborough now listened to their
      execrations, till from abuse they began to proceed to outrage. Stones were
      thrown at his carriage. One of his servants narrowly escaped being struck.
      Lord Oldborough was alone&mdash;he threw open his carriage-door, and
      sprang out on the step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose life is it you seek?&rdquo; cried he, in a voice which obtained instant
      silence. &ldquo;Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s? Lord Oldborough stands before you. Take his
      life who dares&mdash;a life spent in your service. Strike! but strike
      openly. You are Englishmen, not assassins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning to his servants, he added, in a calm voice, &ldquo;Home&mdash;slowly.
      Not a man here will touch you. Keep your master in sight. If I fall, mark
      by what hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then stepping down into the midst of the people, he crossed the street to
      the flagged pathway, the crowd opening to make way for him. He walked on
      with a deliberate firm step; the mob moving along with him, sometimes
      huzzaing, sometimes uttering horrid execrations in horrid tones. Lord
      Oldborough, preserving absolute silence, still walked on, never turned his
      head, or quickened his pace, till he reached his own house. Then, facing
      the mob, as he stood waiting till the door should be opened, the people,
      struck with his intrepidity, with one accord joined in a shout of
      applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next instant, and before the door was opened, they cried, &ldquo;Hat off!&mdash;Hat
      off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s hat never stirred. A man took up a stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark that man!&rdquo; cried Lord Oldborough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened. &ldquo;Return to your homes, my countrymen, and bless God that
      you have not any of you to answer this night for murder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then entering his house, he took off his hat, and gave it to one of his
      attendants. His secretary, Temple, had run down stairs to meet him,
      inquiring what was the cause of the disturbance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; said Lord Oldborough, &ldquo;that I have served the people, but never
      bent to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse them! they are not worth serving. Oh! I thought they&rsquo;d have taken
      my lord&rsquo;s life that minute,&rdquo; cried his faithful servant Rodney. &ldquo;The sight
      left my eyes. I thought he was gone for ever. Thank God! he&rsquo;s safe. Take
      off my lord&rsquo;s coat&mdash;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;for the soul of me. Curse those
      ungrateful people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not curse them, my good Rodney,&rdquo; said Lord Oldborough, smiling. &ldquo;Poor
      people, they are not ungrateful, only mistaken. Those who mislead them are
      to blame. The English are a fine people. Even an English mob, you see, is
      generous, and just, as far as it knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough was sound asleep this night, before any other individual
      in the house had finished talking of the dangers he had escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The civil and military courage shown by the minister in the sudden attack
      upon his character and person were such as to raise him again at once to
      his former height in public esteem. His enemies were obliged to affect
      admiration. The Greenwich party, foiled in this attempt, now disavowed it.
      News of a victory effaced the memory of the late disappointment. Stocks
      rose&mdash;addresses for a change of ministry were quashed&mdash;addresses
      of thanks and congratulation poured in&mdash;Lord Oldborough gave them to
      Mr. Temple to answer, and kept the strength of his attention fixed upon
      the great objects which were essential to the nation and the sovereign he
      served.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Falconer saw that the storm had blown over, the darkness was past&mdash;Lord
      Oldborough, firm and superior, stood bright in power, and before him the
      commissioner bent more obsequious, more anxious than ever. Anxious he
      might well be&mdash;unhappy father! the life, perhaps, of one of his sons,
      his honour, certainly, at stake&mdash;the fortune of another&mdash;his
      existence ruined! And what hopes of propitiating him, who had so suffered
      by the favour he had already shown, who had been betrayed by one of the
      family and disgraced by another. The commissioner&rsquo;s only hope was in the
      recollection of the words, &ldquo;I pity you from my soul, sir,&rdquo; which burst
      from Lord Oldborough even at the moment when he had most reason to be
      enraged against Colonel Falconer. Following up this idea, and working on
      the generous compassion, of which, but for this indication, he should not
      have supposed the stern Lord Oldborough to be susceptible, the
      commissioner appeared before him every day the image of a broken-hearted
      father. In silence Lord Oldborough from time to time looked at him; and by
      these looks, more than by all the promises of all the great men who had
      ever spoken to him, Mr. Falconer was reassured; and, as he told Mrs.
      Falconer, who at this time was in dreadful anxiety, he felt certain that
      Lord Oldborough would not punish him for the faults of his sons&mdash;he
      was satisfied that his place and his pension would not be taken from him&mdash;and
      that, at least in fortune, they should not be utterly ruined. In this
      security the commissioner showed rather more than his customary degree of
      strength of mind, and more knowledge of Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s character than
      he had upon most other occasions evinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things were in this state, when, one morning, after the minister had given
      orders that no one should be admitted, as he was dictating some public
      papers of consequence to Mr. Temple, the Duke of Greenwich was announced.
      His grace sent in a note to signify that he waited upon Lord Oldborough by
      order of his majesty; and that, if this hour were not convenient, he
      begged to have the hour named at which his grace could be admitted. His
      grace was admitted instantly. Mr. Temple retired&mdash;for it was evident
      this was to be a secret conference. His grace of Greenwich entered with
      the most important solemnity&mdash;infinitely more ceremonious than usual;
      he was at last seated, and, after heavy and audible sighs, still hesitated
      to open his business. Through the affected gloom and dejection of his
      countenance Lord Oldborough saw a malicious pleasure lurking, whilst, in a
      studied exordium, he spoke of the infinite reluctance with which he had
      been compelled, by his majesty&rsquo;s express orders, to wait upon his lordship
      on a business the most painful to his feelings. As being a public
      colleague&mdash;as a near and dear connexion&mdash;as a friend in long
      habits of intimacy with his lordship, he had prayed his majesty to be
      excused; but it was his majesty&rsquo;s pleasure: he had only now to beg his
      lordship to believe that it was with infinite concern, &amp;c. Lord
      Oldborough, though suffering under this circumlocution, never condescended
      to show any symptom of impatience; but allowing his grace to run the
      changes on the words and forms of apology, when these were exhausted, his
      lordship simply said, that &ldquo;his majesty&rsquo;s pleasure of course precluded all
      necessity for apology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His grace was vexed to find Lord Oldborough still unmoved&mdash;he was
      sure this tranquillity could not long endure: he continued, &ldquo;A sad
      business, my lord&mdash;a terrible discovery&mdash;I really can hardly
      bring myself to speak&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough gave his grace no assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My private regard,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile of contempt on Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your lordship&rsquo;s hitherto invulnerable public integrity&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A glance of indignation from Lord Oldborough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Hitherto</i> invulnerable!&mdash;your grace will explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let these&mdash;these fatal notes&mdash;letters&mdash;unfortunately got
      into the hands of a leading, impracticable member of opposition, and by
      him laid&mdash;Would that I had been apprised, or could have conceived it
      possible, time enough to prevent that step; but it was done before I had
      the slightest intimation&mdash;laid before his majesty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough calmly received the letters from his grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own handwriting, and private seal, I perceive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The duke sighed&mdash;and whilst Lord Oldborough drew out, opened, and
      read the first letter in the parcel, his grace went on&mdash;&ldquo;This affair
      has thrown us all into the greatest consternation. It is to be brought
      before parliament immediately&mdash;unless a resignation should take place&mdash;which
      we should all deplore. The impudence, the inveteracy of that fellow, is
      astonishing&mdash;no silencing him. We might hush up the affair if his
      majesty had not been apprised; but where the interest of the service is
      concerned, his majesty is warm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His majesty!&rdquo; cried Lord Oldborough: &ldquo;His majesty could not, I trust, for
      a moment imagine these letters to be I mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for the hand and seal which I understood your lordship to
      acknowledge, I am persuaded his majesty could not have believed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believed! My king! did he believe it?&rdquo; cried Lord Oldborough. His
      agitation was for a moment excessive, uncontrollable. &ldquo;No! that I will
      never credit, till I have it from his own lips.&rdquo; Then commanding himself,
      &ldquo;Your grace will have the goodness to leave these letters with me till
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His grace, with infinite politeness and regret, was under the necessity of
      refusing this request. His orders were only to show the letters to his
      lordship, and then to restore them to the hands of the member of
      opposition who had laid them before his majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough took off the cover of one of the letters, on which was
      merely the address and seal. The address was written also at the bottom of
      the letter enclosed, therefore the cover could not be of the least
      importance. The duke could not, Lord Oldborough said, refuse to leave this
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this his grace agreed&mdash;protesting that he was far from wishing to
      make difficulties. If there were any thing else he could do&mdash;any
      thing his lordship would wish to have privately insinuated or publicly
      said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship, with proud thanks, assured the duke he did not wish to have
      any thing privately insinuated; and whatever it was necessary to say or do
      publicly, he should do himself, or give orders to have done. His lordship
      entered into no farther explanation. The duke at last was obliged to take
      his leave, earnestly hoping and trusting that this business would
      terminate to his lordship&rsquo;s entire satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was the duke gone than Lord Oldborough rang for his carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately&mdash;and Mr. Temple, instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whilst his carriage was coming to the door, in the shortest manner
      possible Lord Oldborough stated the facts to his secretary, that letters
      had been forged in his lordship&rsquo;s name, promising to certain persons
      promotion in the army&mdash;and navy&mdash;gratification&mdash;and
      pensions. Some were addressed to persons who had actually obtained
      promotion, shortly after the time of these letters; others contained
      reproaches for having been ill-used. Even from the rapid glance Lord
      Oldborough had taken of these papers, he had retained the names of several
      of the persons to whom they were addressed&mdash;and the nature of the
      promotion obtained. They were persons who could have had no claim upon an
      honest minister. His lordship left a list of them with Mr. Temple&mdash;also
      the cover of the letter, on which was a specimen of the forged writing and
      the private seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to the king. In my absence, Mr. Temple, think for me&mdash;I
      know you feel for me. The object is to discover the authors of this
      forgery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, may I consult with Mr. Alfred Percy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;with no other person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s day for doing business with the king. He was
      late&mdash;the king was going out to ride. His majesty received the
      minister as usual; but notwithstanding the condescension of his majesty&rsquo;s
      words and manner, it was evident to Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s penetration, that
      there was a coldness and formality in the king&rsquo;s countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg I may not detain your majesty&mdash;I see I am late,&rdquo; said Lord
      Oldborough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the business urgent, my lord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; for it concerns principally myself: it can, therefore, wait your
      majesty&rsquo;s leisure at any hour your majesty may appoint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king dismounted instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This moment, my lord, I am at leisure for any business that concerns your
      lordship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king returned to the palace&mdash;Lord Oldborough followed, and all
      the spectators on foot and horseback were left full of curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the condescension of his majesty&rsquo;s words and manner, and
      the polite promptitude to attend to any business that concerned his
      lordship, it was evident to Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s penetration that there was
      an unusual coldness and formality in the king&rsquo;s countenance and
      deportment, unlike the graciousness of his reception when satisfied and
      pleased. As soon as the business of the day had been gone through, Lord
      Oldborough said he must now beg his majesty&rsquo;s attention on a subject which
      principally concerned himself. The king looked as one prepared to hear,
      but determined to say as little as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough placed himself so as to give the king the advantage of the
      light, which he did not fear to have full on his own countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, certain letters, signed with my name, and sealed with my seal, have,
      I am informed, been laid before your majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your lordship has been rightly informed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust&mdash;I hope that your majesty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the firm assertion, in the tone with which Lord Oldborough pronounced,
      I <i>trust</i>&mdash;his majesty&rsquo;s eye changed&mdash;and moved away from
      Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s, when he, with respectful interrogation of tone, added,
      &ldquo;I <i>hope</i> your majesty could not believe those letters to be mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frankly, my lord,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;the assertions, the insinuations of no
      man, or set of men, of any rank or weight in my dominions, could by any
      imaginable means have induced me to conceive it possible that such letters
      had been written by your lordship. Not for one moment could my belief have
      been compelled by any evidence less strong than your lordship&rsquo;s
      handwriting and seal. I own, I thought I knew your lordship&rsquo;s seal and
      writing; but I now see that I have been deceived, and I rejoice to see
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank your majesty. I cannot feel surprise that a forgery and a
      counterfeit which, at first view, compelled my own belief of their being
      genuine, should, for a moment, have deceived you, sir; but, I own, I had
      flattered myself that my sovereign knew my heart and character, yet better
      than my seal and signature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I should have hoped that, if your majesty had perused those letters,
      no assertions could have been necessary, on my part, to convince you, sir,
      that they could not be mine. I have now only to rejoice that your majesty
      is undeceived; and that I have not intruded unnecessarily with this
      explanation. I am fully sensible, sir, of your goodness, in having thus
      permitted me to make, as early as possible, this assertion of my
      innocence. For the proofs of it, and for the detection of the guilty, I am
      preparing; and I hope to make these as clear to you, sir, as your
      majesty&rsquo;s assurance of the pleasure you feel in being undeceived is
      satisfactory&mdash;consolatory to me,&rdquo; concluded Lord Oldborough, with a
      bow of profound yet proud respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;I have no doubt that this affair will redound
      to your honour, and <i>terminate to your lordship&rsquo;s entire satisfaction</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The very phrase used by the Duke of Greenwich.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to myself, your lordship can have no farther anxiety; but I wish your
      lordship&rsquo;s endeavours to detect and bring proofs home to the guilty may be
      promptly successful&mdash;for the gratification of your own feelings, and
      the satisfaction of the public mind, before the matter should be brought
      forward in parliament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His majesty bowed, and as Lord Oldborough retired, he added some gracious
      phrases, expressive of the high esteem he felt for the minister, and the
      interest he had always, and should always take, in whatever could
      contribute to his public and private&mdash;<i>satisfaction</i>&mdash;(again).
    </p>
    <p>
      To an eye and ear less practised in courts than this minister&rsquo;s, all that
      had been said would have been really satisfactory: but Lord Oldborough
      discerned a secret embarrassment in the smile, a constraint in the manner,
      a care, an effort to be gracious in the language, a caution, a rounding of
      the periods, a recurrence to technical phrases of compliment and amity, a
      want of the free fluent language of the heart; language which, as it
      flows, whether from sovereign or subject, leaves a trace that the art of
      courtier or of monarch cannot imitate. In all attempts at such imitation,
      there is a want, of which vanity and even interest is not always sensible,
      but which feeling perceives instantly. Lord Oldborough felt it&mdash;and
      twice, during this audience, he was on the point of offering his
      resignation, and twice, exerting strong power over himself, he refrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw plainly that he was not where he had been in the king&rsquo;s confidence;
      that his enemies had been at work, and, in some measure, had succeeded;
      that suspicions had been infused into the king&rsquo;s mind. That his king had
      doubted him, his majesty had confessed&mdash;and Lord Oldborough discerned
      that there was no genuine joy at the moment his majesty was undeceived, no
      real anxiety for his honour, only the ostensible manifestation suitable to
      the occasion&mdash;repeatable&mdash;or recordable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still there was nothing of which he could complain; every expression, if
      written down or repeated, must have appeared proper and gracious from the
      sovereign to his minister; and for that minister to resign at such a
      moment, from pride or pique, would have been fatal to the dignity, perhaps
      to the integrity, of his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough reasoned thus as he stood in the presence of the king, and
      compelled himself, during the whole audience, and to the last parting
      moment, to preserve an air and tone of calm, respectful self-possession.

      CHAPTER XXXVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      During Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s absence, his faithful secretary had been active
      in his service. Mr. Temple went immediately to his friend Alfred Percy.
      Alfred had just returned fatigued from the courts, and was resting
      himself, in conversation with his wife and Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to disturb you, Alfred,&rdquo; said Mr. Temple, &ldquo;but I must take you
      away from these ladies to consult you on particular business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! let the particular business wait till he has rested himself,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Percy, &ldquo;unless it be a matter of life and death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life and death!&rdquo; cried Lady Frances Arlington, running in at the open
      door&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, it is a matter of life and death!&mdash;Stay, Mr. Temple!
      Mr. Percy! going the moment I come into the room&mdash;Impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible it would be,&rdquo; said Mr. Temple, &ldquo;in any other case; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;When a lady&rsquo;s in the case,
    You know all other things give place,&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      cried Lady Frances. &ldquo;So, positively, gentlemen, I stop the way. But, Mr.
      Temple, to comfort you&mdash;for I never saw a man, gallant or ungallant,
      look so impatient&mdash;I shall not be able to stay above a moment&mdash;Thank
      you, Mrs. Percy, I can&rsquo;t sit down&mdash;Mrs. Crabstock, the crossest of
      Crabstocks and stiffest of pattern-women, is in the carriage waiting for
      me. Give me joy&mdash;I have accomplished my purpose, and without Lady
      Jane Granville&rsquo;s assistance&mdash;obtained a permit to go with Lady Trant,
      and made her take me to Lady Angelica&rsquo;s last night. Grand conversazione!&mdash;Saw
      the German baron! Caught both the profiles&mdash;have &lsquo;em here&mdash;defy
      you not to smile. Look,&rdquo; cried her ladyship, drawing out of her <i>reticule</i>
      a caricature, which she put into Caroline&rsquo;s hand; and, whilst she was
      looking at it, Lady Frances went on speaking rapidly. &ldquo;Only a sketch, a
      scrawl in pencil, while they thought I was copying a Sonnet to Wisdom&mdash;on
      the worst bit of paper, too, in the world&mdash;old cover of a letter I
      stole from Lady Trant&rsquo;s <i>reticule</i> while she was at cards. Mr.
      Temple, you shall see my <i>chef-d&rsquo;oeuvre</i> by and by; don&rsquo;t look at the
      reverse of the medal, pray. Did not I tell you, you were the most
      impatient man in the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true that Mr. Temple was at this instant most impatient to get
      possession of the paper, for on the back of that cover of the letter, on
      which the caricature was drawn, the hand-writing of the direction appeared
      to him&mdash;He dared scarcely believe his eyes&mdash;his hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Crabstock, my lady,&rdquo; said the footman, &ldquo;is waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, sir,&rdquo; said Lady Frances: &ldquo;so, Caroline, you won&rsquo;t see the
      likeness. Very well; if I can&rsquo;t get a compliment, I must be off. When you
      draw a caricature, I won&rsquo;t praise it. Here! Mr. Temple, one look, since
      you are dying for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One look will not satisfy me,&rdquo; cried Mr. Temple, seizing the paper: &ldquo;your
      ladyship must leave the drawing with us till to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Us&mdash;must</i>. Given at our court of St. James&rsquo;s. Lord
      Oldborough&rsquo;s own imperative style.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imperative! no; humbly I beseech your ladyship, thus humbly,&rdquo; cried Mr.
      Temple, kneeling in jest, but keeping in earnest fast hold of the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why&mdash;why? Are you acquainted with Lady Angelica? I did not know
      you knew her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is excellent!&mdash;It is admirable!&mdash;I cannot let it go. This
      hand that seized it long shall hold the prize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s mad! But don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll give it to you&mdash;I would not give
      it to my mother: but I&rsquo;ll lend it to you, if you&rsquo;ll tell me honestly why
      you want it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honestly&mdash;I want to show it to a particular friend, who will be
      delighted with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me who, this minute, or you shall not have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Crabstock, my lady, bids me say, the duchess&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The duchess&mdash;the deuce!&mdash;if she&rsquo;s come to the duchess, I must
      go. I hope your man, Mrs. Percy, won&rsquo;t tell Mrs. Crabstock he saw this
      gentleman kneeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Crabstock&rsquo;s getting out, my lady,&rdquo; said the footman, returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Temple, for mercy&rsquo;s sake, get up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, till your ladyship gives the drawing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! there! let me go&mdash;audacious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning to you, Mrs. Percy&mdash;Good bye, Caroline&mdash;Be at Lady
      Jane&rsquo;s to-night, for I&rsquo;m to be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship ran off, and met Mrs. Crabstock on the stairs, with whom we
      leave her to make her peace as she pleases.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Temple, I believe you are out of your senses,&rdquo; said Alfred: &ldquo;I
      never saw any man so importunate about a drawing that is not worth a straw&mdash;trembling
      with eagerness, and kneeling!&mdash;Caroline, what do you think Rosamond
      would have thought of all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she knew the whole, she would have thought I acted admirably,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Temple. &ldquo;But come, I have business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred took him into his study, and there the whole affair was explained.
      Mr. Temple had brought with him the specimen of the forgery to show to
      Alfred, and, upon comparing it with the handwriting on the cover of the
      letter on which the caricature was drawn, the similarity appeared to be
      strikingly exact. The cover, which had been stolen, as Lady Frances
      Arlington said, from Lady Trant&rsquo;s <i>reticule</i>, was directed to Captain
      Nuttall. He was one of the persons to whom forged letters had been
      written, as appeared by the list which Lord Oldborough had left with Mr.
      Temple. The secretary was almost certain that his lordship had never
      written with his own hand to any Captain Nuttall; but this he could ask
      the moment he should see Lord Oldborough again. It seemed as if this paper
      had never been actually used as the cover of a letter, for it had no
      post-mark, seal, or wafer. Upon farther inspection, it was perceived that
      a <i>t</i> had been left out in the name of <i>Nuttall</i>; and it
      appeared probable that the cover had been thrown aside, and a new one
      written, in consequence of this omission. But Alfred did not think it
      possible that Lady Trant could be the forger of these letters, because he
      had seen some of her ladyship&rsquo;s notes of invitation to Caroline, and they
      were written in a wretched cramped hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that cramped hand might be feigned to conceal the powers of
      penmanship,&rdquo; said Mr. Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! granting her ladyship&rsquo;s talents were equal to the mere execution,&rdquo;
       Alfred persisted in thinking she had not abilities sufficient to invent or
      combine all the parts of such a scheme. &ldquo;She might be an accomplice, but
      she must have had a principal&mdash;and who could that principal be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same suspicion, the same person, came at the same moment into the
      heads of both gentlemen, as they sat looking at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is an intimacy between them,&rdquo; said Alfred. &ldquo;Recollect all the pains
      Lady Trant took for Mrs. Falconer about English Clay&mdash;they&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Falconer! But how could she possibly get at Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s
      private seal&mdash;a seal that is always locked up&mdash;a seal never used
      to any common letter, never to any but those written by his own hand to
      some private friend, and on some very particular occasion? Since I have
      been with him I have not seen him use that seal three times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When and to whom, can you recollect?&rdquo; said Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I recollect!&mdash;I have it all!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Temple, striking the
      table&mdash;&ldquo;I have it! But, Lady Frances Arlington&mdash;I am sorry she
      is gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! what of her?&mdash;Lady Frances can have nothing more to do with the
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has a great deal more, I can assure you&mdash;but without knowing
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of that I am certain, or all the world would have known it long ago: but
      tell me how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I recollect, at the time when I was dangling after Lady Frances&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      good in every thing&mdash;just before we went down to Falconer-court, her
      ladyship, who, you know, has always some reigning fancy, was distracted
      about what she called <i>bread-seals</i>. She took off the impression of
      seals with bread&mdash;no matter how, but she did&mdash;and used to
      torment me&mdash;no, I thought it a great pleasure at the time&mdash;to
      procure for her all the pretty seals I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, surely, you did not give her Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&mdash;not I!&mdash;how could you imagine such a thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were in love, and might have forgotten consequences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man in love may forget every thing, I grant&mdash;except his fidelity.
      No, I never gave the seal; but I perfectly recollect Lady Frances showing
      it to me in her collection, and my asking her how she came by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the cover of a note which the duke, her uncle, had received from
      Lord Oldborough; and I, at the time, remembered his lordship&rsquo;s having
      written it to the Duke of Greenwich on the birth of his grandson. Lord
      Oldborough had, upon a former occasion, affronted his grace by sending him
      a note sealed with a wafer&mdash;this time his lordship took special care,
      and sealed it with his private <i>seal of honour</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! But how does this bring the matter home to Mrs. Falconer?&rdquo; said
      Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay&mdash;I am bringing it as near home to her as possible. We all went
      down to Falconer-court together; and there I remember Lady Frances had her
      collection of bread-seals, and was daubing and colouring them with
      vermilion&mdash;and Mrs. Falconer was so anxious about them&mdash;and Lady
      Frances gave her several&mdash;I must see Lady Frances again directly, to
      inquire whether she gave her, among the rest, Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      go to Lady Jane Granville&rsquo;s this evening on purpose. But had I not better
      go this moment to Lady Trant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred advised, that having traced the matter thus far, they should not
      hazard giving any alarm to Lady Trant or to Mrs. Falconer, but should
      report to Lord Oldborough what progress had been made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Temple accordingly went home, to be in readiness for his lordship&rsquo;s
      return. In the mean time the first exaltation of indignant pride having
      subsided, and his cool judgment reflecting upon what had passed, Lord
      Oldborough considered that, however satisfactory to his own mind might be
      the feeling of his innocence, the proofs of it were necessary to satisfy
      the public; he saw that his character would be left doubtful, and at the
      mercy of his enemies, if he were in pique and resentment hastily to
      resign, before he had vindicated his integrity. &ldquo;<i>If</i> your proofs be
      produced, my lord!&rdquo;&mdash;these words recurred to him, and his anxiety to
      obtain these proofs rose high; and high was his satisfaction the moment he
      saw his secretary, for by the first glance at Mr. Temple&rsquo;s countenance he
      perceived that some discovery had been made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred, that night, received through Mr. Temple his lordship&rsquo;s request,
      that he would obtain what farther information he could relative to the
      private seal, in whatever way he thought most prudent. His lordship
      trusted entirely to his discretion&mdash;Mr. Temple was engaged with other
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred went with Caroline to Lady Jane Granville&rsquo;s, to meet Lady Frances
      Arlington; he entered into conversation, and by degrees brought her to his
      point, playing all the time with her curiosity, and humouring her
      childishness, while he carried on his cross-examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first she could not recollect any thing about making the seals he
      talked of. &ldquo;It was a fancy that had passed&mdash;and a past fancy,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;was like a past love, or a past beauty, good for nothing but to be
      forgotten.&rdquo; However, by proper leading of the witness, and suggesting
      time, place, and circumstance, he did bring to the fair lady&rsquo;s mind all
      that he wanted her to remember. She could not conceive what interest Mr.
      Percy could take in the matter&mdash;it was some jest about Mr. Temple,
      she was sure. Yes, she did recollect a seal with a Cupid riding a lion,
      that Mr. Temple gave her just before they went to Falconer-court&mdash;was
      that what he meant?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;but a curious seal&mdash;&rdquo; (Alfred described the device.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s! Yes, there was some such odd seal.&rdquo; But it was not
      given to her by Mr. Temple&mdash;she took that from a note to her uncle,
      the Duke of Greenwich.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes&mdash;that, Alfred said, he knew; but what did her ladyship do with
      it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know how I got it! Bless me! you seem to know every thing I do and
      say. You know my affairs vastly well&mdash;you act the conjuror admirably&mdash;pray,
      can you tell me whom I am to marry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I will&mdash;when your ladyship has told me to whom you gave that
      seal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I would, and welcome, if I could recollect&mdash;but I really can&rsquo;t.
      If you think I gave it to Mr. Temple, I assure you, you are mistaken&mdash;you
      may ask him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know your ladyship did not give it to Mr. Temple&mdash;but to whom did
      you give it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember now&mdash;not to any gentleman, after all&mdash;you are
      positively out. I gave it to Mrs. Falconer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are certain of that, Lady Frances Arlington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am certain, Mr. Alfred Percy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how can you prove it to me, Lady Frances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The easiest way in the world&mdash;by asking Mrs. Falconer. Only I don&rsquo;t
      go there now much, since Georgiana and I have quarrelled&mdash;but what
      can make you so curious about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a secret.&rdquo;&mdash;At the word <i>secret</i>, her attention was
      fixed.&mdash;&ldquo;May I ask if your ladyship would know the seal again if you
      saw it?&mdash;Is this any thing like the impression?&rdquo; (showing her the
      seal on the forged cover.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very same that I gave Mrs. Falconer, I&rsquo;ll swear to it&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell
      you how I know it particularly. There&rsquo;s a little outer rim here, with
      points to it, which there is not to the other. I fastened my bread-seal
      into an old setting of my own, from which I had lost the stone. Mrs.
      Falconer took a fancy to it, among a number of others, so I let her have
      it. Now I have answered all your questions&mdash;answer mine&mdash;Whom am
      I to marry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ladyship will marry whomsoever&mdash;your ladyship <i>pleases</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was an ambiguous answer,&rdquo; she observed; &ldquo;for that she <i>pleased</i>
      every body.&rdquo; Her ladyship was going to run on with some further questions,
      but Alfred pretending that the oracle was not permitted to answer more
      explicitly, left her completely in the dark as to what his meaning had
      been in this whole conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reported progress to Lord Oldborough&mdash;and his lordship slept as
      soundly this night as he did the night after he had been attacked by the
      mob.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the first person he desired to see was Mr. Falconer&mdash;his
      lordship sent for him into his cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Commissioner Falconer, I promised to give you notice, whenever I
      should see any probability of my going out of power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heaven! my lord,&rdquo; exclaimed the commissioner, starting back. The
      surprise, the consternation were real&mdash;Lord Oldborough had his eye
      upon him to determine that point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible, surely!&mdash;I hope&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hope flitted at the moment to the Duke of Greenwich&mdash;but returned
      instantly: he had made no terms&mdash;had missed his time. If Lord
      Oldborough should go out of office&mdash;his place, his pension, gone&mdash;utter
      ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough marked the vacillation and confusion of his countenance,
      and saw that he was quite unprepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope&mdash;Merciful Powers! I trust&mdash;I thought your lordship had
      triumphed over all your enemies, and was firmer in favour and power than
      ever. What can have occurred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without making any answer, Lord Oldborough beckoned to the commissioner to
      approach nearer the window where his lordship was standing, and then
      suddenly put into his hand the cover with the forged handwriting and seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to understand by this, my lord?&rdquo; said the bewildered
      commissioner, turning it backwards and forwards. &ldquo;Captain Nuttall!&mdash;I
      never saw the man in my life. May I ask, my lord, what I am to comprehend
      from this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, sir, that you know nothing of the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole was explained by Lord Oldborough succinctly. The astonishment
      and horror in the poor commissioner&rsquo;s countenance and gestures, and still
      more, the eagerness with which he begged to be permitted to try to
      discover the authors of this forgery, were sufficient proofs that he had
      not the slightest suspicion that the guilt could be traced to any of his
      own family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s look, fixed on the commissioner, expressed what it had
      once before expressed&mdash;&ldquo;Sir, from my soul, I pity you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner saw this look, and wondered why Lord Oldborough should
      pity <i>him</i> at a time when all his lordship&rsquo;s feelings should
      naturally be for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, I would engage we shall discover&mdash;we shall trace it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that I have discovered&mdash;that I have traced it,&rdquo; said Lord
      Oldborough; and he sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that sigh was more incomprehensible to the commissioner than all the
      rest, and he stood with his lips open for a moment before he could utter,
      &ldquo;Why then resign, my lord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my affair,&rdquo; said Lord Oldborough. &ldquo;Let us, if you please, sir,
      think of yours; for, probably, this is the only time I shall ever more
      have it in my power to be of the least service to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my lord&mdash;my lord, don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; said the commissioner quite
      forgetting all his artificial manner, and speaking naturally: &ldquo;the last
      time you shall have it in your power!&mdash;Oh! my dear lord, don&rsquo;t say
      so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, I must&mdash;it gives me pain&mdash;you see it does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At such a time as this to think of me instead of yourself! My lord, I
      never knew you till this moment&mdash;so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I you, sir,&rdquo; said Lord Oldborough. &ldquo;It is the more unfortunate for us
      both, that our connexion and intercourse must now for ever cease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never, my lord, if you were to go out of power to-morrow&mdash;which
      Heaven, in its mercy and justice, forbid! I could never forget the
      goodness&mdash;I would never desert&mdash;in spite of all interest&mdash;I
      should continue&mdash;I hope your lordship would permit me to pay my duty&mdash;all
      intercourse could never cease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough saw, and almost smiled at the struggle between the
      courtier and the man&mdash;the confusion in the commissioner&rsquo;s mind
      between his feelings and his interest. Partly his lordship relieved, and
      partly he pained Mr. Falconer, by saying, in his firm tone, &ldquo;I thank you,
      Mr. Falconer; but all intercourse must cease. After this hour, we meet no
      more. I beg you, sir, to collect your spirits, and to listen to me calmly.
      Before this day is at an end, you will understand why all farther
      intercourse between us would be useless to your interest, and incompatible
      with my honour. Before many hours are past, a blow will be struck which
      will go to your heart&mdash;for I see you have one&mdash;and deprive you
      of the power of thought. It is my wish to make that blow fall as lightly
      upon you as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my lord, your resignation would indeed be a blow I could never
      recover. The bare apprehension deprives me at this moment of all power of
      thought; but still I hope&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear me, sir, I beg, without interruption: it is my business to think for
      you. Go immediately to the Duke of Greenwich, make what terms with him you
      can&mdash;make what advantage you can of the secret of my approaching
      resignation&mdash;a secret I now put in your power to communicate to his
      grace, and which no one yet suspects&mdash;I having told it to no one
      living but to yourself. Go quickly to the duke&mdash;time presses&mdash;I
      wish you success&mdash;and a better patron than I have been, than my
      principles would permit me to be. Farewell, Mr. Falconer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner moved towards the door when Lord Oldborough said &ldquo;<i>Time
      presses</i>;&rdquo; but the commissioner stopped&mdash;turned back&mdash;could
      not go: the tears&mdash;real tears&mdash;rolled down his cheeks&mdash;Lord
      Oldborough went forward, and held out his hand to him&mdash;the
      commissioner kissed it, with the reverence with which he would have kissed
      his sovereign&rsquo;s hand; and bowing, he involuntarily backed to the door, as
      if quitting the presence of majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pity that man was bred a mere courtier, and that he is cursed
      with a family on none of whom there is any dependence,&rdquo; thought Lord
      Oldborough, as the door closed upon the commissioner for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough delayed an hour purposely, to give Mr. Falconer advantage
      of the day with the Duke of Greenwich: then ordered his carriage, and
      drove to&mdash;Mrs. Falconer&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great was her surprise at the minister&rsquo;s entrance.&mdash;&ldquo;Concerned the
      commissioner was not at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My business is with Mrs. Falconer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord&mdash;your lordship&mdash;the honour and the pleasure of a visit&mdash;Georgiana,
      my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer nodded to her daughter, who most unwillingly, and as if
      dying with curiosity, retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smile died away upon Mrs. Falconer&rsquo;s lips as she observed the stern
      gravity of Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s countenance. She moved a chair towards his
      lordship&mdash;he stood, and leaning on the back of the chair, paused, as
      he looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to come?&mdash;Cunningham, perhaps,&rdquo; thought Mrs. Falconer; &ldquo;or
      perhaps something about John. When will he speak?&mdash;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I
      must&mdash;I am happy to see your lordship looking so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mrs. Falconer acquainted with Lady Trant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Trant&mdash;yes, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy! Is it possible?&mdash;No, for her own sake she would not betray
      me,&rdquo; thought Mrs. Falconer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Intimately?&rdquo; said Lord Oldborough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Intimately&mdash;that is, as one&rsquo;s intimate with every body of a certain
      sort&mdash;one visits&mdash;but no farther&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say I have the
      honour&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer was so distracted by seeing Lord Oldborough searching in his
      pocket-book for a letter, that in spite of all her presence of mind, she
      knew not what she said; and all her presence of countenance failed, when
      Lord Oldborough placed before her eyes the cover directed to Captain
      Nuttall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you guess how this came into Lady Trant&rsquo;s possession, madam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I protest, my lord,&rdquo; her voice trembling, in spite of her utmost efforts
      to command it, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;nor can I conceive&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor can you conceive by whom it was written, madam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears&mdash;it bears a resemblance&mdash;some likeness&mdash;as far
      as I recollect&mdash;but it is so long since I have seen your lordship&rsquo;s
      own hand&mdash;and hands are so like&mdash;sometimes&mdash;and I am so bad
      a judge&mdash;every hand, all fashionable hands, are so like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And every seal like every seal?&rdquo; said Lord Oldborough, placing the
      counterfeit seal before Mrs. Falconer. &ldquo;I recommend it to you, madam, to
      waste no farther time in evasion; but to deliver to me the counterpart of
      this seal, the impression of my private seal, which you had from Lady
      Frances Arlington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mere bread-seal! Her ladyship surely has not said&mdash;I really have
      lost it&mdash;if I ever had it&mdash;I declare your lordship terrifies me
      so, by this strange mode&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I recommend it to you once more, madam, and for the last time I earnestly
      recommend it to you, to deliver up to me that seal, for I have sworn to my
      belief that it is in your possession; a warrant will in consequence be
      issued, to seize and search your papers. The purport of my present visit,
      of which I should gladly have been spared the pain, is to save you, madam,
      from the public disgrace of having a warrant executed. Do not faint,
      madam, if you can avoid it, nor go into hysterics; for if you do, I must
      retire, and the warrant must be executed. Your best course is to open that
      desk, to give me up the seal, to make to me at this instant a full
      confession of all you know of this transaction. If you do thus, for your
      husband&rsquo;s sake, madam, I will, as far as I can consistently with what is
      due to myself, spare you the shame of an arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer, with trembling hands, unlocked the desk, and delivered the
      seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a letter which I see in the same hand-writing, madam, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave it; and then, unable to support herself longer, sunk upon a sofa:
      but she neither fainted nor screamed&mdash;she was aware of the
      consequences. Lord Oldborough opened the window to give her air. She was
      relieved by a burst of tears, and was silent&mdash;and nothing was heard
      but her sobs, which she endeavoured to suppress in vain. She was more
      relieved on looking up by one glance at Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s countenance,
      where she saw compassion working strongly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before she could take any advantage of it, the expression was changed,
      the feeling was controlled: he was conscious of its weakness&mdash;he
      recollected what public justice, and justice to his own character,
      required&mdash;he recollected all the treachery, the criminality, of which
      she had been guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, you are not now in a condition, I see, to explain yourself farther&mdash;I
      will relieve you from my presence: my reproaches you will never hear; but
      I shall expect from you, before one hour, such an avowal in writing of
      this whole transaction, as may, with the written confession of Lady Trant,
      afford the proofs which are due to my sovereign, and to the public, of my
      integrity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Falconer bowed her head, covered her face, clasped her hands in
      agony: as Lord Oldborough retired, she sprang up, followed to throw
      herself at his feet, yet without knowing what she could say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The commissioner is innocent!&mdash;If you forsake him, he is undone&mdash;all,
      all of us, utterly ruined! Oh! Georgiana! Georgiana! where are you? speak
      for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Georgiana was in an inner apartment, trying on a new robe <i>à la
      Georgienne</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever you may wish farther to say to me, madam,&rdquo; said Lord Oldborough,
      disengaging himself from her, and passing decidedly on, before Georgiana
      appeared, &ldquo;you will put in writing, and let me have within this hour&mdash;or
      never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Within that hour, Commissioner Falconer brought, for Lord Oldborough, the
      paper his wife had drawn up, but which he was obliged to deliver to Mr.
      Temple; for Lord Oldborough had so ordered, and his lordship persevered in
      refusing to see him more. Mrs. Falconer&rsquo;s paper was worded with all the
      art and address of which she was mistress, and all the pathos she could
      command&mdash;Lord Oldborough looked only for facts&mdash;these he marked
      with his pencil, and observed where they corroborated and where they
      differed from Lady Trant&rsquo;s confession, which Mr. Temple had been charged
      to obtain during his lordship&rsquo;s visit to Mrs. Falconer. The greater part
      of the night Lord Oldborough and Mr. Alfred Percy were employed arranging
      these documents, so as to put the proofs in the clearest and shortest
      form, to be laid before his majesty the succeeding day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that Mrs. Falconer had been first tempted to these practices
      by the distress for money into which extravagant entertainments, or, as
      she stated, the expenses incident to her situation&mdash;expenses which
      far exceeded her income&mdash;had led her. It was supposed, from her
      having kept open house at times for the minister, that she and the
      commissioner had great influence; she had been applied to&mdash;presents
      had been offered, and she had long withstood. But at length, Lady Trant
      acting in concert with her, they had been supplied with information by a
      clerk in one of the offices, a relation of Lady Trant, who was a vain,
      incautious youth, and, it seems, did not know the use made of his
      indiscretion: he told what promotions he heard spoken of&mdash;what
      commissions were making out. The ladies prophesied, and their prophecies
      being accomplished, they gained credit. For some time they kept themselves
      behind the scenes&mdash;and many, applying to A.B., and dealing with they
      did not know whom, paid for promotions which would have come unpaid for;
      others paid, and were never promoted, and wrote letters of reproach&mdash;Captain
      Nuttall was among these, and he it was, who, finding himself duped, first
      stirred in the business; and by means of an active member of opposition,
      to whom he made known his secret grievance, brought the whole to light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proofs arranged (and Lord Oldborough never slept till they were
      perfected), he reposed tranquilly. The next day, asking an audience of his
      majesty, he simply laid the papers on his majesty&rsquo;s table, observing that
      he had been so fortunate as to succeed in tracing the forgery, and that he
      trusted these papers contained all the necessary proofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship bowed and retired instantly, leaving his majesty to examine
      the papers alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resolution to resign his ministerial station had long been forming in
      Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s mind. It was not a resolution taken suddenly in pride or
      pique, but after reflection, and upon strong reasons. It was a measure
      which he had long been revolving in his secret thoughts. During the
      enthusiasm of political life, the proverbial warnings against the vanity
      of ambition, and the danger of dependence on the favour of princes, had
      passed on his ear but as a schoolboy&rsquo;s lesson: a phrase &ldquo;to point a moral,
      or adorn a tale.&rdquo; He was not a reading man, and the maxims of books he
      disregarded or disbelieved; but in the observations he made for himself he
      trusted: the lessons he drew from life were never lost upon him, and he
      acted in consequence of that which he believed, with a decision, vigour,
      and invariability, seldom found even among philosophers. Of late years he
      had, in real life, seen striking instances of the treachery of courtiers,
      and had felt some symptoms of insecurity in the smile of princes. Fortune
      had been favourable to him&mdash;she was fickle&mdash;he determined to
      quit her before she should change. Ambition, it is true, had tempted him&mdash;he
      had risen to her highest pinnacle: he would not be hurled from high&mdash;he
      would descend voluntarily, and with dignity. Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s habits of
      thought were as different as possible from those of a metaphysician: he
      had reflected less upon the course of his own mind than upon almost any
      other subject; but he knew human nature practically; disquisitions on
      habit, passion, or the sovereign good, were unread by him, nor, in the
      course of his life, had he ever formed a system, moral or prudential; but
      the same penetration, the same <i>longanimity</i>, which enabled him to
      govern the affairs of a great nation, gave him, when his attention turned
      towards himself, a foresight for his own happiness. In the meridian of
      life, he had cherished ambition, as the only passion that could supply him
      with motive strong enough to call great powers into great action. But of
      late years he had felt something, not only of the waywardness of fortune,
      but of the approaches of age&mdash;not in his mind, but in his health,
      which had suffered by his exertions. The attacks of hereditary gout had
      become more violent and more frequent. If he lived, these would, probably,
      at seasons, often incapacitate him from his arduous ministerial duties:
      much, that he did well, must be ill done by deputy. He had ever reprobated
      the practice of leaving the business of the nation to be done by clerks
      and underlings in office. Yet to this the minister, however able, however
      honest, must come at last, if he persist in engrossing business and power
      beyond what an individual can wield. Love for his country, a sense of his
      own honour, integrity, and consistency, here combined to determine this
      great minister to retire while it was yet time&mdash;to secure, at once,
      the dignity and happiness of the evening of life. The day had been devoted
      to good and high purposes&mdash;that was enough&mdash;he could now,
      self-satisfied and full of honour, bid adieu to ambition. This resolution,
      once formed, was fixed. In vain even his sovereign endeavoured to dissuade
      him from carrying it into execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the king had examined the papers which Lord Oldborough had laid
      before him, his majesty sent for his lordship again, and the moment the
      minister entered the cabinet, his majesty expressed his perfect
      satisfaction in seeing that his lordship had, with so little trouble, and
      with his usual ability, got to the bottom of this affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was to be done next? The Duke of Greenwich was to be summoned. His
      grace was in astonishment when he saw the papers which contained Lord
      Oldborough&rsquo;s complete vindication, and the crimination of Mrs. Falconer.
      Through the whole, as he read on, his grace had but one idea, viz.
      &ldquo;Commissioner Falconer has deceived me with false intelligence of the
      intended resignation.&rdquo; Not one word was said by Lord Oldborough to give
      his grace hope of that event&mdash;till the member of opposition by whom
      the forged letters had been produced&mdash;till all those who knew or had
      heard any thing of the transaction were clearly and fully apprised of the
      truth. After this was established, and that all saw Lord Oldborough clear
      and bright in honour, and, at least apparently, as firm in power as he had
      ever been, to the astonishment of his sovereign his lordship begged
      permission to resign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever might have been the effect of misrepresentation, to lower Lord
      Oldborough&rsquo;s favour, at the moment when he spoke of retiring, his king
      recollected all his past services&mdash;all that must, in future, be
      hazarded and lost in parting with such a minister&mdash;so eminent in
      abilities, of such tried integrity, of such fidelity, such attachment to
      his person, such a zealous supporter of royalty, such a favourite with his
      people, so successful as well as so able a minister! Never was he so much
      valued as at this moment. All his sovereign&rsquo;s early attachment returned in
      full strength and warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lord, you must not&mdash;you will not leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These simple words, spoken with the warmth of the heart, touched Lord
      Oldborough more than can be told. It was difficult to resist them,
      especially when he saw tears in the eyes of the monarch whom he loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his resolution was taken. He thanked his majesty, not with the
      common-place thanks of courtiers, but with his whole heart and soul he
      thanked his majesty for this gracious condescension&mdash;this testimony
      of approbation&mdash;these proofs of sensibility to his attachment, which
      paid&mdash;overpaid him, in a moment, for the labours of a life. The
      recollection of them would be the glory, the solace of his age&mdash;could
      never leave his memory while life lasted&mdash;would, he thought, be
      present to him, if he should retain his senses, in his dying moment. But
      he was, in the midst of this strong feeling, firm to the resolution his
      reason had taken. He humbly represented, that he had waited for a
      favourable time when the affairs of the country were in a prosperous
      train, when there were few difficulties to embarrass those whom his
      majesty might name to succeed to his place at the head of administration:
      there were many who were ambitious of that station&mdash;zeal, talents,
      and the activity of youth were at his majesty&rsquo;s command. For himself, he
      found it necessary for his health and happiness to retire from public
      business; and to resign the arduous trust with which he had been honoured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, if I must accept of your resignation, I must&mdash;but I do it
      with regret. Is there any thing your lordship wishes&mdash;any thing you
      will name for yourself or your friends, that I can do, to show my sense of
      your services and merit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For myself, your majesty&rsquo;s bounty has left me nothing to wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your friends, then, my lord?&mdash;Let me have the satisfaction of
      obliging you through them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more gracious or more gratifying than the whole of this
      parting audience. It was Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s last audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of his resignation, quickly whispered at court, was not that day
      publicly known or announced. The next morning his lordship&rsquo;s door was
      crowded beyond example in the memory of ministers. Mr. Temple, by his
      lordship&rsquo;s order, announced as soon as possible the minister&rsquo;s having
      resigned. All were in astonishment&mdash;many in sorrow: some few&mdash;a
      very few of the most insignificant of the crowd, persons incapable of
      generous sympathy, who thought they could follow their own paltry
      interests unnoticed&mdash;left the room, without paying their farewell
      respects to this great minister&mdash;minister now no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he appeared, there was sudden silence. All eyes were fixed upon
      him, every one pressing to get into the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, thank you for these marks of attention&mdash;of regard. Mr.
      Temple has told you&mdash;you know, my friends, that I am a man without
      power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know,&rdquo; answered a distinguished gentleman, &ldquo;that you are Lord
      Oldborough. With or without power, the same in the eyes of your friends,
      and of the British nation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough bowed low, and looked gratified. His lordship then went
      round the circle with an air more cheerful, more free from reserve, than
      usual; with something in his manner more of sensibility, but nothing less
      of dignity. All who merited distinction he distinguished by some few
      appropriate words, which each remembered afterwards, and repeated to their
      families and friends. He spoke or listened to each individual with the
      attention of one who is courting, not quitting, popularity. Free from that
      restraint and responsibility which his public and ministerial duties had
      imposed upon him, he now entered into the private concerns of all, and
      gave his parting assistance or counsel. He noted all grievances&mdash;registered
      all promises that ought to be recommended to the care of his successor in
      office. The wishes of many, to whom he had forborne to give any
      encouragement, he now unexpectedly fulfilled and surpassed. When all were
      satisfied, and had nothing more to ask or to hope from him, they yet
      delayed, and parted from Lord Oldborough with difficulty and regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      A proof that justice commands more than any other quality the respect and
      gratitude of mankind. Take time and numbers into the calculation, and all
      discover, in their turn, the advantage of this virtue. This minister, a
      few regretted instances excepted, had shown no favour, but strict justice,
      in his patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s requests for his friends were granted&mdash;all his
      recommendations attended to: it was grateful to him to feel that his
      influence lasted after his power had ceased. Though the sun had apparently
      set, its parting rays continued to brighten and cheer the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under a new minister, Mr. Temple declined accepting of the embassy which
      had been offered to him. Remuneration suitable to his services, and to the
      high terms in which Lord Oldborough had spoken of his merit, was promised;
      and without waiting to see in what form, or manner, this promise would be
      accomplished, the secretary asked and obtained permission to accompany his
      revered master to his retirement. Alfred Percy, zealous and ardent in Lord
      Oldborough&rsquo;s service, the more this great man&rsquo;s character had risen upon
      his admiration, had already hastened to the country to prepare every thing
      at Clermont-park for his reception. By his orders, that establishment had
      been retrenched; by Alfred Percy&rsquo;s activity it was restored. Services,
      which the richest nobleman in the land could not have purchased, or the
      highest have commanded, Alfred was proud to pay as a voluntary tribute to
      a noble character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough set out for the country at a very early hour in the
      morning, and no one previously knew his intentions, except Mr. Temple. He
      was desirous to avoid what it had been whispered was the design of the
      people, to attend him in crowds through the streets of the metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they drove out of town, Lord Oldborough recollected that in some
      account, either of the Duke of Marlborough, or the Duke of Ormond&rsquo;s
      leaving London, after his dismission from court, it is said, that of all
      those whom the duke had served, all those who had courted and flattered
      him in the time of his prosperity and power, none showed any gratitude or
      attachment, excepting one page, who appeared at the coach-door as his
      master was departing, and gave some signs of genuine sorrow and respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am fortunate,&rdquo; said Lord Oldborough, &ldquo;in having few complaints to make
      of ingratitude. I make none. The few I might make,&rdquo; continued his
      lordship, who now rewarded Mr. Temple&rsquo;s approved fidelity, by speaking to
      him with the openness and confidence of friendship, &ldquo;the few I might make
      have been chiefly caused by errors of my own in the choice of the persons
      I have obliged. I thank Heaven, however, that upon the whole I leave
      public life not only with a good conscience, but with a good opinion of
      human nature. I speak not of courtiers&mdash;there is nothing of nature
      about them&mdash;they are what circumstances make them. Were I to live my
      life over again, the hours spent with courtiers are those which I should
      most wish to be spared; but by a statesman, or a minister, these cannot be
      avoided. For myself, in resigning my ministerial office, I might say, as
      Charles the Fifth, when he abdicated, said to his successor, &lsquo;I leave you
      a heavy burthen; for since my shoulders have borne it, I have not passed
      one day exempt from anxiety.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But from the first moment I started in the course of ambition, I was
      aware that tranquillity must be sacrificed; and to the last moment I
      abided by the sacrifice. The good I had in view, I have reached&mdash;the
      prize at which I aimed, I have won. The glory of England was my object&mdash;her
      approbation my reward. Generous people!&mdash;If ever I bore toil or peril
      in your cause, I am rewarded, and never shall you hear me say that &lsquo;the
      unfruitful glories please no more.&rsquo; The esteem of my sovereign!&mdash;I
      possess it. It is indefeasibly mine. His favour, his smiles, are his to
      give, or take away. Never shall he hear from me the <i>wailings</i> of
      disappointed ambition.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Caroline took advantage of the opportunity of returning home with her
      brother Alfred, when he went to the country, to prepare Clermont-park for
      the reception of Lord Oldborough. And now she saw her home again with more
      than wonted delight. Every thing animate and inanimate seemed to smile
      upon her, every heart rejoiced at her return; and she enjoyed equally the
      pleasure of loving, and of being beloved by, such friends. She had been
      amused and admired during her residence in London; but a life of
      dissipation she had always thought, and now she was convinced from
      experience, could never suit her taste or character. She would immediately
      have resumed her former occupations, if Rosamond would have permitted; but
      Rosamond took entire possession of her at every moment when her father or
      mother had not claimed their prior right to hear and to be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caroline, my dear, don&rsquo;t natter yourself that you shall be left in peace&mdash;See!&mdash;she
      is sitting down to write a letter, as if she had not been away from us
      these six months&mdash;You must write to Lady Jane Granville!&mdash;Well,
      finish your gratitude quickly&mdash;and no more writing, reading, or
      drawing, this day; you must think of nothing but talking, or listening to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Much as she loved talking in general, Rosamond now so far preferred the
      pleasure of hearing, that, with her eyes fixed on Caroline, her
      countenance varying with every variety of Caroline&rsquo;s expression, she sat
      perfectly silent all the time her sister spoke. And scarcely was her voice
      heard, even in exclamation. But, during the pauses of narrative, when the
      pause lasted more than a minute, she would say, &ldquo;Go on, my dear Caroline,
      go on. Tell us something more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was interrupted by the sudden entrance of Mr. Temple&mdash;and
      Rosamond did not immediately find her fluency of speech increase. Mr.
      Temple had seized the first moment that duty and gratitude to his master
      and friend permitted to hasten to the Hills, nor had Lord Oldborough been
      unmindful of his feelings. Little as his lordship was disposed to think of
      love affairs, it seems he recollected those of his secretary; for, the
      morning after their arrival at Clermont-park, when he proffered his
      services, Lord Oldborough said, that he had only to trouble Mr. Temple to
      pay a visit for him, if it would not be disagreeable, to his old friend
      Mr. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him that I know his first wish will be to come to show me that it is
      the man, not the minister, for whom he had a regard: tell him this proof
      of his esteem is unnecessary. He will wish to see me for another reason:
      he is a philosopher&mdash;and will have a philosophical curiosity to
      discover how I exist without ambition. But of that he cannot yet form a
      judgment&mdash;nor can I: therefore, if he pleases, let his visit be
      delayed till next week. I have some papers to arrange, which I should wish
      to show him, and I cannot have them sooner in readiness. If you, Mr.
      Temple, can contrive to pass this week at Mr. Percy&rsquo;s, let me not detain
      you. There is no fear,&rdquo; added he, smiling, that &ldquo;in solitude I should be
      troubled by the spectre which haunted the minister in Gil Blas in his
      retirement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never was man happier than Mr. Temple, when he found himself in the midst
      of the family circle at the Hills, and seated beside Rosamond, free from
      all cares, all business, all intrigues of courtiers, and restraints of
      office; no longer in the horrors of, attendance and dependence, but with
      the promise of a competent provision for life&mdash;with the consciousness
      of its having been, honourably obtained; and to brighten all, the hope,
      the delightful hope, of soon prevailing on the woman he loved, to become
      his for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred Percy had been obliged to return directly to London, and for once
      in his life Mr. Temple benefited by the absence of his friend. In the
      small house at the Hills, Alfred&rsquo;s was the only room that could have been
      spared for him; and in this room, scarcely fourteen feet square, the
      ex-secretary found himself lodged more entirely to his satisfaction than
      he had ever been in the sumptuous apartments of the great. The happy are
      not fastidious as to their accommodations; they never miss the painted
      ceiling, or the long arcade, and their slumbers require no bed of down.
      The lover&rsquo;s only fear was, that this happy week would pass too swiftly;
      and, indeed, time flew unperceived by him, and by Rosamond. One fine day,
      after dinner, Mrs. Percy proposed, that instead of sitting longer in the
      house, they should have their dessert of strawberries in some pleasant
      place in the lawn or wood. Rosamond eagerly seconded this proposal, and
      whispered, &ldquo;Caroline&rsquo;s bower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thither they went. This bower of Caroline, this favourite spot, Rosamond,
      during her sister&rsquo;s absence, had taken delight in ornamenting, and it did
      credit as much to her taste as to her kindness. She had opened a view on
      one side to a waterfall among the rocks; on the other, to a winding path
      descending through the glen. Honey-suckle, rose, and eglantine, near the
      bower, were in rich and wild profusion; all these, the song of birds, and
      even the smell of the new-mown grass, seemed peculiarly delightful to Mr.
      Temple. Of late years he had been doomed to close confinement in a capital
      city; but all his tastes were rural, and, as he said, he feared he should
      expose himself to the ridicule Dr. Johnson throws on those &ldquo;who talk of
      sheep and goats, and who babble of green fields.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy thought Dr. Johnson was rather too intolerant of rural
      description, and of the praises of a country life, but acknowledged that
      he quite agreed with him in disliking, pastorals&mdash;excepting always
      that beautiful drama, &ldquo;The Gentle Shepherd.&rdquo; Mr. Percy said, that, in his
      opinion, a life purely pastoral must, if it could be realized, prove as
      insufferably tiresome in reality, as it usually is found to be in fiction.
      He hated Delias and shepherdesses, and declared that he should soon grow
      tired of any companion with whom he had no other occupation in common but
      &ldquo;<i>tending a few sheep</i>.&rdquo; There was a vast difference, he thought,
      between pastoral and domestic life. His idea of domestic life comprised
      all the varieties of literature, exercise, and amusement for the
      faculties, with the delights of cultivated society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation turned from pastoral life and pastorals to Scotch and
      English ballads and songs. Their various merits of simplicity, pathos, or
      elegance, were compared and discussed. After the Reliques of Ancient
      Poetry had been sufficiently admired, Rosamond and Caroline mentioned two
      modern compositions, both by the same author, each exquisite in its
      different style of poetry&mdash;one beautiful, the other sublime.
      Rosamond&rsquo;s favourite was the Exile of Erin; Caroline&rsquo;s, the Mariners of
      England. To justify their tastes, they repeated the poems. Caroline fixed
      the attention of the company on the flag, which has
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Braved a thousand years the battle and the breeze,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      when suddenly her own attention seemed to be distracted by some object in
      the glen below. She endeavoured to go on, but her voice faltered&mdash;her
      colour changed. Rosamond, whose quick eye followed her sister&rsquo;s, instantly
      caught a glimpse of a gentleman coming up the path from the glen. Rosamond
      started from her seat, and clasping her hands, exclaimed, &ldquo;It is! It <i>is</i>
      he!&mdash;It is Count Altenberg!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had not recovered from their astonishment when Count Altenberg stood
      before them. To Mr. Percy, to Mrs. Percy, to Rosamond, to each he spoke,
      before he said one word to Caroline. But one look had said all, had
      spoken, and had been understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he was not married she was certain&mdash;for that look said he loved
      her&mdash;and her confidence in his honour was secure: Whatever had
      delayed his return, or had been mysterious in his conduct, she felt
      convinced that he had never been to blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      And on his part did he read as distinctly the truth in her countenance?&mdash;Was
      the high colour, the radiant pleasure in that countenance unmarked? The
      joy was so veiled by feminine modesty, that he doubted, trembled, and if
      at last the rapid feelings ended in hope, it was respectful hope. With
      deference the most marked, mingled with dignity, tenderness, and passion,
      he approached Caroline. He was too delicate, too well-bred, to distress
      her by distinguishing her more particularly; but as he took the seat,
      which she left for him beside her mother, the open and serene expression
      of her eye, with the soft sound of her voice, in the few words she
      answered to what he said, were enough to set his heart at ease. The sight
      of Mr. Temple had at first alarmed the Count, but the alarm was only
      momentary. One glance at Rosamond re-assured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ideas, which it requires many words to tell, passed instantaneously with
      the rapidity of light. After they were seated, some minutes were spent in
      common-place questions and answers, such as those which Benjamin Franklin
      would wisely put all together, into one formula, to satisfy curiosity.
      Count Altenberg landed the preceding day&mdash;had not stopped to see any
      one in England&mdash;had not even heard of Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s resignation&mdash;had
      proceeded directly to the Hills&mdash;had left his equipage at a town a
      few miles distant&mdash;thought he had been fully master of the well-known
      road, but the approach having been lately changed, he had missed his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      This settled, to make room for a more interesting explanation, Mr. Temple
      had the politeness to withdraw. Rosamond had the humanity, and Caroline
      the discretion, to accompany him in his walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg then said, addressing himself to Mr. Percy, on whose
      regard he seemed to have reliance, and to Mrs. Percy, whom he appeared
      most anxious to interest in his favour, &ldquo;You certainly, sir, as a man of
      penetration, and a father; you, madam, as a mother, and as a lady who must
      have been accustomed to the admiration of our sex, could not avoid seeing,
      when I was in this country before, that I felt the highest admiration,
      that I had formed the strongest attachment for your daughter&mdash;Miss
      Caroline Percy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Percy both acknowledged that they thought Count Altenberg had
      shown some preference for Caroline; but as he had never declared his
      attachment, they had not felt themselves justified in inferring more from
      his attentions than his general good opinion. A change in his manner,
      which they observed shortly before they quitted Hungerford Castle, had
      impressed them with the idea that he had no such views as they had once
      been led to imagine, and their never having heard any thing from him
      since, had confirmed them in this belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Painful&mdash;exquisitely painful, as it was to me,&rdquo; said Count
      Altenberg, &ldquo;I felt myself bound in honour to leave you in that error; and,
      at all hazards to myself, to suffer you to continue under that persuasion,
      as I was then, and have been till within these few days, in dread of being
      obliged to fulfil an engagement, made without my concurrence or knowledge,
      and which must for ever have precluded me from indulging the first wish of
      my heart. The moment, literally the moment I was at liberty, I hastened
      hither, to declare my real sentiments, and to solicit your permission to
      address your daughter. But before I can expect that permission, before I
      can hope for your approbation of my suit&mdash;an approbation which, I am
      well aware, must depend entirely upon your opinion of my character&mdash;I
      must, to explain whatever may have appeared unintelligible in my conduct,
      be permitted to make you fully acquainted with the circumstances in which
      I have been placed.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Beginning with the history of his father&rsquo;s letters and his own, respecting
      the projected marriage with the Countess Christina, he related, nearly as
      follows, all that passed, after his having, in obedience to his father&rsquo;s
      summons, returned home. He found contracts drawn up and ready for his
      signature&mdash;the friends of both families apprized of the proposed
      alliance, and every thing actually prepared for his marriage.
      Remonstrances with his father were vain. The old Count said that it was
      impossible to break off the match, that his honour and the honour of his
      house was pledged. But independently of all promises, he considered the
      accomplishment of this marriage as most desirable and advantageous: with
      all the vehemence of affection, and all the force of parental authority,
      he charged his son to fulfil his engagements. The old Count was a fond but
      an imperious father; a good but an ambitious man. It was his belief that
      love is such a transient passion, that it is folly to sacrifice to its
      indulgence any of the solid and permanent interests of life. His
      experience at courts, and his observation on the gallantries of young
      princes and nobles, had taught him to believe that love is not only a
      transient, but a variable and capricious feeling, easily changing its
      object, and subsisting only by novelty. All that his son said of his
      attachment to Caroline, of the certainty of its permanence, and of its
      being essential to the happiness of his life, the father heard but as the
      common language of every enamoured youth. He let his son speak without
      interruption, but smiled incredulous, and listened only as to the voice of
      one in the paroxysm of a passion, which, however violent, would
      necessarily subside. Between the fits, he endeavoured to control the fever
      of his mind, and as a spell repeated these words, &ldquo;Albert! see the young
      Countess Christina&mdash;but once&mdash;I ask no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert, with the respect due to a father, but with the firmness due to
      himself, and with all the courage which love only could have given to
      oppose the authority and affection of a parent, refused to ratify the
      contract that had been prepared, and declined the proposed interview. He
      doubted not, he said, that the lady was all his father described&mdash;beautiful,
      amiable, and of transcendant talents; he doubted not her power to win any
      but a heart already won. He would enter into no invidious comparisons, nor
      bid defiance to her charms&mdash;his own choice was made, he was sure of
      his constancy, and he thought it not only the most honourable course, but
      the most respectful to the Lady Christina, ingenuously at once, and
      without having any interview with her, or her friends, to state the truth&mdash;that
      the treaty had been commenced by his father without his knowledge, and
      carried on under total ignorance of an attachment he had formed in
      England. The father, after some expressions of anger and disappointment,
      was silent, and appeared to acquiesce. He no longer openly urged the
      proposed interview, but he secretly contrived that it should take place.
      At a masked ball at court, Count Albert entered into conversation with a
      Minerva, whose majestic air and figure distinguished her above her
      companions, whose language, thoughts, and sentiments, perfectly sustained
      the character which she assumed. He was struck with admiration by her
      talents, and by a certain elevation of thought and sentiment, which, in
      all she said, seemed the habitual expression of a real character, not the
      strained language of a feigned personage. She took off her mask&mdash;he
      was dazzled by her beauty. They were at this moment surrounded by numbers
      of her friends and of his, who were watching the effect produced by this
      interview. His father, satisfied by the admiration he saw in Count
      Albert&rsquo;s countenance, when they both took off their masks, approached and
      whispered, &ldquo;the Countess Christina.&rdquo; Count Altenberg grew pale, and for a
      moment stood in silent consternation. The lady smiled with an air of
      haughty superiority, which in some degree relieved him, by calling his own
      pride to his aid, and by convincing him that tenderness, or feminine
      timidity, which he would have most dreaded to wound, were not the
      characteristics of her mind. He instantly asked permission to pay his
      respects to her at her father&rsquo;s palace the ensuing day. She changed colour&mdash;darted
      a penetrating glance at the Count; and after an incomprehensible and quick
      alternation of pleasure and pain in her countenance, she replied, that
      &ldquo;she consented to grant Count Albert Altenberg that interview which he and
      their mutual friends desired.&rdquo; She then retired with friends from the
      assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the haughtiness of her demeanour, it had been obvious that she
      had desired to make an impression upon Count Albert; and all who knew her
      agreed that she had never on any occasion been seen to exert herself so
      much to shine and please. She shone, but had not pleased. The father,
      however, was content; an interview was promised&mdash;he trusted to the
      charms and talents of the Countess&mdash;he trusted to her flattering
      desire to captivate, and with impatience and confidence, he waited for the
      event of the succeeding day. Some intervening hours, a night of feverish
      and agonizing suspense, would have been spared to Count Albert, had he at
      this time known any thing of an intrigue&mdash;an intrigue which an artful
      enemy had been carrying on, with design to mortify, disgrace, and ruin his
      house. The plan was worthy of him by whom it was formed&mdash;M. de
      Tourville&mdash;a person, between whom and Count Albert there seemed an
      incompatibility of character, and even of manner; an aversion openly,
      indiscreetly shown by the Count, even from his boyish years, but
      cautiously concealed on the part of M. de Tourville, masked in courtly
      smiles and a diplomatic air of perfect consideration. Fear mixed with M.
      de Tourville&rsquo;s dislike. He was aware that if Count Albert continued in
      confidence with the hereditary prince, he would, when the prince should
      assume the reins of government, become, in all probability, his prime
      minister, and then adieu to all M. de Tourville&rsquo;s hopes of rising to
      favour and fortune. Fertile in the resources of intrigue, gallant and
      political, he combined them, upon this occasion, with exquisite address.
      When the Countess Christina was first presented at court, he had observed
      that the Prince was struck by her beauty. M. de Tourville took every means
      that a courtier well knows how to employ, to flatter the taste by which he
      hoped to benefit. In secret he insinuated into the lady&rsquo;s ear that she was
      admired by the prince. M. de Tourville knew her to be of an aspiring
      character, and rightly judged that ambition was her strongest passion.
      When once the hope of captivating the prince had been suggested to her,
      she began to disdain the proposed alliance with the house of Altenberg;
      but she concealed this disdain, till she could show it with security: she
      played her part with all the ability, foresight, and consummate prudence,
      of which ambition, undisturbed by love, is capable. Many obstacles opposed
      her views: the projected marriage with Count Albert Altenberg&mdash;the
      certainty that the reigning prince would never consent to his son&rsquo;s
      forming an alliance with the daughter of a subject. But the old Prince was
      dying, and the Lady Christina calculated, that till his decease, she could
      protract the time appointed for her marriage with Count Albert. The young
      Prince might then break off the projected match, prevail upon the Emperor
      to create her a Princess of the empire, and then, without derogating from
      his rank, or giving offence to German ideas of propriety, he might gratify
      his passion, and accomplish the fulness of her ambition. Determined to
      take no counsel but her own, she never opened her scheme to any of her
      friends, but pursued her plan secretly, in concert with M. de Tourville,
      whom she considered but as a humble instrument devoted to her service. He
      all the while considering her merely as a puppet, played by his art, to
      secure at once the purposes of his interest and of his hatred. He thought
      he foresaw that Count Albert would never yield his intended bride
      peaceably to his prince&mdash;he knew nothing of the Count&rsquo;s attachment in
      England&mdash;the Lady Christina was charming&mdash;the alliance highly
      advantageous to the house of Altenberg&mdash;the breaking off such a
      marriage, and the disappointment of a passion which he thought the young
      Countess could not fail to inspire, would, as M. de Tourville hoped,
      produce an irreparable breach between the Prince and his favourite. On
      Count Albert&rsquo;s return from England, symptoms of alarm and jealousy had
      appeared in the Prince, unmarked by all but by the Countess Christina, and
      by the confidant, who was in the secret of his passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far M. de Tourville&rsquo;s scheme had prospered, and from the character of
      the hereditary Prince, it was likely to succeed in its ultimate view. He
      was a Prince of good dispositions, but wanting in resolution and civil
      courage: capable of resisting the allurements of pleasure for a certain
      time, but soon weary of painful endurance in any cause; with a taste for
      virtue, but destitute of that power to bear and forbear, without which
      there is no virtue: a hero, when supported by a stronger mind, such as
      that of his friend, Count Albert; but relaxing and sinking at once, when
      exposed to the influence of a flatterer such as M. de Tourville: subject
      to exquisite shame and self-reproach, when he had acted contrary to his
      own idea of right; yet, from the very same weakness that made him err,
      disposed to be obstinate in error. M. de Tourville argued well from his
      knowledge of his character, that the Prince, enamoured as he was of the
      charms of the fair Christina, would not long be able to resist his
      passion; and that if once he broke through his sense of honour, and
      declared that passion to the destined bride of his friend, he would ever
      afterwards shun and detest the man whom he had injured. All this M. de
      Tourville had admirably well combined: no man understood and managed
      better the weaknesses of human nature, but its strength he could not so
      well estimate; and as for generosity, as he could not believe in its
      sincerity, he was never prepared for its effects. The struggles which the
      Prince made against his passion were greater, and of longer duration, than
      M. de Tourville had expected. If Count Albert had continued absent, the
      Prince might have been brought more easily to betray him; but his return
      recalled, in the midst of love and jealousy, the sense of respect he had
      for the superior character of this friend of his early days: he knew the
      value of a friend&mdash;even at the moment he yielded his faith to a
      flatterer. He could not at once forfeit the esteem of the being who
      esteemed him most&mdash;he could not sacrifice the interest, and as he
      thought, the happiness, of the man who loved him best. The attachment his
      favourite had shown him, his truth, his confiding openness of temper, the
      pleasure in his countenance when he saw him first upon his return from
      England, all these operated on the heart of the Prince, and no declaration
      of his passion had been made at the time when the appointed interview took
      place between Count Albert and the Countess Christina at her father&rsquo;s
      palace. Her friends not doubting that her marriage was on the eve of its
      accomplishment, had no scruple, even in that court of etiquette, in
      permitting the affianced lovers to have as private a conference as each
      seemed to desire. The lady&rsquo;s manner was this morning most alarmingly
      gracious. Count Albert was, however, struck by a difference in her air the
      moment she was alone with him, from what it had been whilst in the
      presence of her friends. All that he might without vanity have interpreted
      as marking a desire to please, to show him favour, and to evince her
      approbation, at least, of the choice her friends had made for her,
      vanished the moment they withdrew. What her motives might be, Count
      Altenberg could not guess; but the hope he now felt, that she was not
      really inclined to consider him with partiality, rendered it more easy to
      enter into that explanation, upon which he was, at all events, resolved.
      With all the delicacy due to her sex, with all the deference due to her
      character, and all the softenings by which politeness can soothe and
      conciliate pride, he revealed to the Countess Christina the real state of
      his affections: he told her the whole truth, concluding, by repeating the
      assurance of his belief, that her charms and merit would be irresistible
      to any heart that was disengaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady heard him in astonishment: for this turn of fate she had been
      wholly unprepared&mdash;the idea of his being attached to another had
      never once presented itself to her imagination; she had never calculated
      on the possibility that her alliance should be declined by any individual
      of a family less than sovereign. She possessed, however, pride of
      character superior to her pride of rank, and strength of mind suited to
      the loftiness of her ambition. With dignity in her air and countenance,
      after a pause of reflection, she replied, &ldquo;Count Albert Altenberg is, I
      find, equal to the high character I have heard of him: deserving of my
      esteem and confidence, by that which can alone command esteem and merit
      confidence&mdash;sincerity. His example has recalled me to my nobler self,
      and he has, in this moment, rescued me from the labyrinth of a
      diplomatist. Count Albert&rsquo;s sincerity I&mdash;little accustomed to
      imitation, but proud to <i>follow</i> in what is good and great&mdash;shall
      imitate. Know then, sir, that my heart, like your own, is engaged: and
      that you may be convinced I do not mock your ear with the semblance of
      confidence, I shall, at whatever hazard to myself, trust to you my secret.
      My affections have a high object&mdash;are fixed upon him, whose friend
      and favourite Count Albert Altenberg deservedly is. I should scorn myself&mdash;no
      throne upon earth could raise me in my own opinion, if I could deceive or
      betray the man who has treated me with such sincerity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Relieved at once by this explanation, and admiring the manner in which it
      was made, mingled joy and admiration were manifest in his countenance; and
      the lady forgave him the joy, in consideration of the tribute he paid to
      her superiority. Admiration was a tribute he was most willing to yield at
      this moment, when released from that engagement to love, which it had been
      impossible for him to fulfil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Countess recalled his attention to her affairs and to his own. Without
      his making any inquiry, she told him all that had been done, and all that
      yet remained to be done, for the accomplishment of her hopes: she had been
      assured, she said, by one now in the favour and private confidence of the
      hereditary prince, that his inclination for her was&mdash;painfully and
      with struggles, which, in her eyes, made his royal heart worthy her
      conquest&mdash;suppressed by a sense of honour to his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This conflict would now cease,&rdquo; Count Albert said. &ldquo;It should be his
      immediate care to relieve his Prince from all difficulty on his account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By what means?&rdquo; the Countess asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply by informing him of the truth&mdash;as far as I am concerned. Your
      secret, madam, is safe&mdash;your confidence sacred. Of all that concerns
      myself&mdash;my own attachment, and the resignation of any pretensions
      that might interfere with his, he shall immediately be acquainted with the
      whole truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Countess coloured, and repeating the words, &ldquo;<i>the whole truth</i>,&rdquo;
       looked disconcerted, and in great perplexity replied, that Count Albert&rsquo;s
      speaking to the Prince directly&mdash;his immediate resignation of his
      pretensions&mdash;would, perhaps, defeat her plans. This was not the
      course she had intended to pursue&mdash;far from that which M. de
      Tourville had pointed out. After some moments&rsquo; reflection, she said, &ldquo;I
      abide by the truth&mdash;speak to the prince&mdash;be it so: I trust to
      your honour and discretion to speak to him in such terms as not to
      implicate me, to commit my delicacy, or to derogate from my dignity. We
      shall see then whether he loves me as I desire to be loved. If he does, he
      will free me, at once, from all difficulty with my friends, for he will
      speak <i>en prince</i>&mdash;and not speak in vain; if he loves me not, I
      need not tell you, sir, that you are equally free. My friends shall be
      convinced that I will never be the bride of any other man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the explanation with the Lady Christina, Count Albert lost no time;
      he went instantly to the palace. In his way thither, he was met by one of
      the pages, who told him the Prince desired to see him immediately. He
      found the Prince alone. Advancing to meet him, with great effort in his
      manner to command his emotion, the Prince said, &ldquo;I have sent for you,
      Count Albert, to give you a proof that the friendship of Princes is not,
      in every instance, so vain a thing as it is commonly believed to be. Mine
      for you has withstood strong temptation:&mdash;you come from the Countess
      Christina, I believe, and can measure, better than any one, the force of
      that temptation. Know, that in your absence it has been my misfortune to
      become passionately enamoured of your destined bride; but I have never,
      either by word or look, directly or indirectly, infringed on what I felt
      to be due to your friendship and to my own honour. Never did I give her
      the slightest intimation of my passion, never attempted to take any of the
      advantages which my situation might be supposed to give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count Albert had just received the most convincing testimony corroborating
      these assertions&mdash;he was going to express his sense of the conduct of
      his Prince, and to explain his own situation, but the Prince went on
      speaking with the eagerness of one who fears his own resolution, who has
      to say something which he dreads that he should not be able to resume or
      finish, if his feelings should meet with any interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now let me, as your friend and prince, congratulate you, Count
      Albert, on your happiness; and, with the same sincerity, I request that
      your marriage may not be delayed, and that you will take your bride
      immediately away from my father&rsquo;s court. Time will, I hope, render her
      presence less dangerous; time will, I hope, enable me to enjoy your
      society in safety; and when it shall become my duty to govern this state,
      I shall hope for the assistance of your talents and integrity, and shall
      have deserved, in some degree, your attachment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Count, in the strongest manner, expressed his gratitude to his Prince
      for these proofs of his regard, given under circumstances the most trying
      to the human heart. He felt, at this instant, exquisite pleasure in
      revealing to his highness the truth, in showing him that the sacrifice he
      had so honourably, so generously determined to make, was not requisite,
      that their affections were fixed on different objects, that before Count
      Albert had any idea of the prince&rsquo;s attachment to the Lady Christina, it
      had been his ardent wish, his determination, at all hazards, to break off
      engagements which he could not fulfil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince was in rapturous joy&mdash;all his ease of manner towards his
      friend returned instantly, his affection and confidence flowed in full
      tide. Proud of himself, and happy in the sense of the imminent danger from
      which he had escaped, he now described the late conflicts his heart had
      endured with the eloquence of self-complacency, and with that sense of
      relief which is felt in speaking on the most interesting of all subjects
      to a faithful friend from whom a secret has been painfully concealed. The
      Prince now threw open every thought, every feeling of his mind. Count
      Altenberg rose higher than ever in his favour: not the temporary favourite
      of the moment&mdash;the companion of pleasures&mdash;the flatterer of
      present passion or caprice; but the friend in whom there is certainty of
      sympathy, and security of counsel. The Prince, confiding in Count Albert&rsquo;s
      zeal and superior powers, now took advice from him, and made a confidant
      no longer of M. de Tourville. The very means which that intriguing
      courtier had taken to undermine the Count thus eventually proved the cause
      of establishing more firmly his credit. The plain sincerity of the Count,
      and the generous magnanimity of the lady, at once disconcerted and
      destroyed the artful plan of the diplomatist. M. de Tourville&rsquo;s
      disappointment when he heard from the Countess Christina the result of her
      interview with Count Albert, and the reproaches which in that moment of
      vexation he could not refrain from uttering against the lady for having
      departed from their plan, and having trusted to the Count, unveiled to her
      the meanness of his character and the baseness of his designs. She plainly
      saw that his object had been not to assist her love, but to gratify his
      own hate: not merely to advance his own fortune&mdash;that, she knew, must
      be the first object of every courtier&mdash;but &ldquo;to rise upon the ruins of
      another&rsquo;s fame;&rdquo; and this, she determined, should never be accomplished by
      her assistance, or with her connivance. She put Count Albert on his guard
      against this insidious enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count, grateful to the lady, yet biassed neither by hope of her future
      favour nor by present desire to please, firm in honour and loyalty to the
      Prince who asked his counsel, carefully studied the character of the
      Countess Christina, to determine whether she possessed the qualities fit
      for the high station to which love was impatient that she should be
      elevated. When he was convinced that her character was such as was
      requisite to ensure the private happiness of the prince, to excite him to
      the attainment of true glory&mdash;then, and not till then, he decidedly
      advised the marriage, and zealously offered any assistance in his power to
      promote the union. The hereditary Prince about this time became, by the
      death of his father, sole master of his actions; but it was not prudent to
      begin his government with an act in open defiance of the prejudices or
      customs of his country. By these customs, he could not marry any woman
      under the rank of a Princess; and the Emperor had been known to refuse
      conferring this rank, even on favourites of powerful potentates, by whom
      he had been in the most urgent manner solicited. Count Albert Altenberg
      stood high in the esteem of the Emperor, at whose court he had spent some
      time; and his prince now commissioned him to go to Vienna, and endeavour
      to move the Emperor to concede this point in his favour. This embassy was
      a new and terrible delay to the Count&rsquo;s anxious desire of returning to
      England. But he had offered his services, and he gave them generously. He
      repaired to Vienna, and persevering through many difficulties, at length
      succeeded in obtaining for the Countess the rank of Princess. The
      attachment of the Prince was then publicly declared&mdash;the marriage was
      solemnized&mdash;all approved of the Prince&rsquo;s choice&mdash;all&mdash;except
      the envious, who never approve of the happy. Count Albert received, both
      from the Prince and Princess, the highest marks of esteem and favour. M.
      de Tourville, detected and despised, retired from court in disgrace and in
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after his marriage, the Prince declared his intention of
      appointing Count Albert Altenberg his prime minister; but before he
      entered on the duties of his office and the very moment that he could be
      spared by his Prince, he asked and obtained permission to return to
      England, to the lady on whom his affections were fixed. The old Count, his
      father, satisfied with the turn which affairs had taken, and gratified in
      his utmost ambition by seeing his son minister of state, now willingly
      permitted him to follow his own inclination in the choice of a wife.
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; concluded Count Albert, &ldquo;my father rejoices that my heart is
      devoted to an Englishwoman: having himself married an English lady, he
      knows, from experience, how to appreciate the domestic merits of the
      ladies of England; he is prepossessed in their favour. He agrees, indeed,
      with foreigners of every nation, who have had opportunities of judging,
      and who all allow that&mdash;next to their own countrywomen&mdash;the
      English are the most charming and the most amiable women in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Count had finished, and had pronounced this panegyric of a
      nation, while he thought only of an individual, he paused, anxious to know
      what effect his narrative had produced on Mr. and Mrs. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was gratified both by their words and looks, which gave him full
      assurance of their entire satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And since he had done them the honour of appealing to their opinion, they
      might be permitted to add their complete approbation of every part of his
      conduct, in the difficult circumstances in which he had been placed. They
      were fully sensible of the high honour that such a man as Count Altenberg
      conferred on their daughter by his preference. As to the rest, they must
      refer him to Caroline herself.&rdquo; Mr. Percy said with a grave voice, but
      with a smile from which the Count augured well, &ldquo;that even for the most
      advantageous and, in his opinion, desirable connexion, he would not
      influence his daughter&rsquo;s inclination.&mdash;Caroline must decide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Count, with all the persuasive tenderness and energy of truth and
      love, pleaded his own cause, and was heard by Caroline with a modest,
      dignified, ingenuous sensibility, which increased his passion. Her
      partiality was now heightened by her conviction of the strength and
      steadiness of his attachment; but whilst she acknowledged how high he
      stood in her esteem, and did not attempt to conceal the impression he had
      made on her heart, yet he saw that she dreaded to yield to the passion
      which must at last require from her the sacrifice of her home, country,
      friends, and parents. As long as the idea of being united to him was faint
      and distant, so was the fear of the sacrifices that union might demand;
      but now, the hope, the fear, the certainty, at once pressed on her heart
      with the most agitating urgency. The Count as far as possible relieved her
      mind by the assurance, that though his duty to his Prince and his father,
      that though all his private and public connexions and interests obliged
      him to reside some time in Germany, yet that he could occasionally visit
      England, that he should seize every opportunity of visiting a country he
      preferred to all others; and, for his own sake, he should cultivate the
      friendship of her family, as each individual was in different ways suited
      to his taste and stood high in his esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline listened with fond anxiety to these hopes: she was willing to
      believe in promises which she was convinced were made with entire
      sincerity; and when her affections had been wrought to this point, when
      her resolution was once determined, she never afterwards tormented the man
      to whom she was attached, with wavering doubts and scruples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg&rsquo;s promise to his prince obliged him to return at an
      appointed time. Caroline wished that time had been more distant; she would
      have delighted in spending the spring-time of love in the midst of those
      who had formed till now all the happiness of her life&mdash;with her
      parents, to whom she owed every thing, to whom her gratitude was as warm,
      as strong, as her affection&mdash;with her beloved sister, who had
      sympathized so tenderly in all her sorrow, and who ardently wished to have
      some time allowed to enjoy her happiness. Caroline felt all this, but she
      felt too deeply to display feeling: sensible of what the duty and honour
      of Count Altenberg demanded, she asked for no delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first letters that were written to announce her intended marriage were
      to Mrs. Hungerford and to Lady Jane Granville. And it may be recorded as a
      fact rather unusual, that Caroline was so fortunate as to satisfy all her
      friends: not to offend one of her relations, by telling any too soon, or
      too late, of her intentions. In fact, she made no secret, no mystery,
      where none was required by good sense or propriety. Nor did she
      communicate it under a strict injunction of secrecy to twenty friends, who
      were afterwards each to be angry with the other for having, or not having,
      told that of which they were forbidden to speak. The order of precedency
      in Caroline&rsquo;s confidential communications was approved of even by all the
      parties concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hungerford was at Pembroke with her nieces when she received
      Caroline&rsquo;s letter: her answer was as follows:
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR CHILD,
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ten years younger since I read your letter, therefore do not be
      surprised at the quickness of my motions&mdash;I shall be with you at the
      Hills, in town, or wherever you are, as soon as it is possible, after you
      let me know when and where I can embrace you and our dear Count. At the
      marriage of my niece, Lady Mary Barclay, your mother will remember that I
      prayed to Heaven I might live to see my beloved Caroline united to the man
      of her choice&mdash;I am grateful that this blessing, this completion of
      all my earthly hopes and happiness, has been granted to me.
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;M. ELIZABETH HUNGERFORD.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      The answer of Lady Jane Granville came next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Confidential</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the last <i>confidential</i> letter I shall ever be able to write
      to you&mdash;for a married woman&rsquo;s letters, you know, or you will soon
      know, become, like all the rest of her property, subject to her husband&mdash;excepting
      always the secrets of which she was possessed before marriage, which do
      not go into the common stock, if she be a woman of honour&mdash;so I am
      safe with you, Caroline; and any erroneous opinion I might have formed, or
      any hasty expressions I may have let drop, about a certain Count, you will
      bury in oblivion, and never let me see you look even as if you recollected
      to have heard them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were right, my dear, in that whole business&mdash;I was wrong; and
      all I can say for myself is, that I was wrong with the best possible
      intentions. I now congratulate you with as sincere joy, as if this
      charming match had been made by my advice, under my <i>chaperonage</i>,
      and by favour of that <i>patronage of fashion</i>, of which I know your
      father thinks that both my <i>head</i> and <i>heart</i> are full; there he
      is only half right, after all: so do not let him be too proud. I will not
      allow that my heart is ever wrong, certainly not where you are concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am impatient, my dear Caroline, to see your Count Altenberg. I heard
      him most highly spoken of yesterday by a Polish nobleman, whom I met at
      dinner at the Duke of Greenwich&rsquo;s. Is it true, that the Count is to be
      prime minister of the Prince of &mdash;&mdash;? the Duke of Greenwich
      asked me this question, and I promised I would let his grace know from <i>the
      best possible</i> authority&mdash;but I did not <i>commit</i> you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, my dear, for my own interest. If you have really and cordially
      forgiven me, for having so rashly said, upon a late occasion, that I would
      never forgive you, prove to me your placability and your sincerity&mdash;use
      your all-powerful influence to obtain for me a favour on which I have set
      my heart. Will you prevail on all your house to come up to town directly,
      and take possession of mine?&mdash;Count Altenberg, you say, has business
      to transact with ministers: whilst this is going on, and whilst the
      lawyers are settling preliminaries, where can you all be better than with
      me? I hope I shall be able to make Mr. and Mrs. Percy feel as much at
      home, in one hour&rsquo;s time, as I found myself the first evening after my
      arrival at the Hills some years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the Hungerfords will press you to go to them, and Alfred and Mrs.
      A. Percy will plead <i>nearest of kin</i>&mdash;I can only throw myself
      upon your generosity. The more inducements you have to go to other
      friends, the more I shall feel gratified and obliged, if you favour me
      with this proof of your preference and affection. Indulge me, my dear
      Caroline, perhaps for the last time, with your company, of which, believe
      me, I have, though a woman of the world, sense and feeling sufficient
      fully to appreciate the value. Yours (at all events), ever and
      affectionately,
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;J. GRANVILLE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Spring Gardens&mdash;Tuesday</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P. S.&mdash;I hope your father is of my opinion, that weddings,
      especially among persona of a certain rank of life, ought always to be <i>public</i>,&mdash;attended
      by the friends and connexions of the families, and conducted with
      something of the good old aristocratic formality, pomp, and state, of
      former times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane Granville&rsquo;s polite and urgent request was granted. Caroline and
      all her family had pleasure in showing Lady Jane that they felt grateful
      for her kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Temple obtained permission from Lord Oldborough to accompany the
      Percys to town; and it was settled that Rosamond and Caroline should be
      married on the same day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the morning after their arrival in London, Mr. Temple appeared with a
      countenance very unlike that which had been seen the night before&mdash;Hope
      and joy had fled.&mdash;All pale and in consternation!&mdash;Rosamond was
      ready to die with terror. She was relieved when he declared that the evil
      related only to his fortune. The place that had been promised to him was
      given; indeed&mdash;the word of promise was kept to the ear&mdash;but by
      some management, either of Lord Skreene&rsquo;s or Lord Skrimpshire&rsquo;s, the place
      had been <i>saddled</i> with a pension to the widow of the gentleman by
      whom it had been previously held, and the amount of this pension was such
      as to reduce the profits of the place to an annual income by no means
      sufficient to secure independence, or even competence, to a married man.
      Mr. Temple knew that when the facts were stated to Lord Oldborough, his
      lordship would, by his representations to the highest authority, obtain
      redress; but the secretary was unwilling to implicate him in this
      disagreeable affair, unwilling to trouble his tranquillity again with
      court intrigues, especially, as Mr. Temple said, where his own personal
      interest alone was concerned&mdash;at any rate this business must delay
      his marriage. Count Altenberg could not possibly defer the day named for
      his wedding&mdash;despatches from the continent pressed the absolute
      necessity of his return. Revolutionary symptoms had again appeared in the
      city&mdash;his prince could not dispense with his services. His honour was
      at stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Temple did not attempt or pretend to bear his disappointment like a
      philosopher: he bore it like a lover, that is to say, very ill. Rosamond,
      poor Rosamond, rallied him with as much gaiety as she could command with a
      very heavy heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little time for reflection, her good sense, which, when called
      upon to act, never failed to guide her conduct, induced her to exert
      decisive influence to prevent Mr. Temple from breaking out into violent
      complaints against those in power, by whom he had been ill-treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of being married on the same day with her sister, she said, after
      all, was a mere childish fancy, for which no solid advantage should be
      hazarded; therefore she conjured her lover, not in heat of passion to
      precipitate things, but patiently to wait&mdash;to return and apply to
      Lord Oldborough, if he should find that the representations he had already
      made to Lord Skrimpshire failed of effect. With much reluctance, Mr.
      Temple submitted to postpone the day promised for his marriage; but both
      Mr. and Mrs. Percy so strongly supported Rosamond&rsquo;s arguments, that he was
      compelled to be prudent. Rosamond now thought only of her sister&rsquo;s
      approaching nuptials. Mrs. Hungerford and Mrs. Mortimer arrived in town,
      and all Mr. and Mrs. Percy&rsquo;s troops of friends gathered round them for
      this joyful occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane Granville was peculiarly happy in finding that Mr. Percy agreed
      with her in opinion that marriages ought to be publicly solemnized; and
      rejoiced that, when Caroline should be led to the altar by the man of her
      choice, she would feel that choice sanctioned by the approbation of her
      assembled family and friends. Lady Jane justly observed, that it was
      advantageous to mark as strongly as possible the difference between
      marriages with consent of friends, and clandestine unions, which from
      their very nature must always be as private as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      If some little love of show, and some aristocratic pride of family, mixed
      with Lady Jane&rsquo;s good sense upon this as upon most other occasions, the
      truly philosophic will be inclined to pardon her; for they best know how
      much of all the principles which form the strength and happiness of
      society, depends upon mixed motives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Percy, grateful to Lady Jane, and willing to indulge her
      affection in its own way, gratified her with permission to arrange the
      whole ceremonial of the wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that Rosamond&rsquo;s marriage was postponed, she claimed first right to be
      her sister&rsquo;s bridemaid; Lady Florence Pembroke, Mrs. Hungerford&rsquo;s niece,
      had made her request, and obtained Caroline&rsquo;s promise, to be the second;
      and these were all that Caroline desired to have: but Lady Jane Granville
      evidently wished for the honour and glory of Lady Frances Arlington for a
      third, because she was niece to the Duke of Greenwich; and besides, as
      Lady Jane pleaded, &ldquo;though a little selfish, she really would have been
      generous, if she had not been spoiled: to be sure, she cared in general
      for no one but herself; yet she absolutely showed particular interest
      about Caroline. <i>Besides</i>, her ladyship had set her heart upon the
      matter, and never would forgive a disappointment of a fancy.&rdquo; Her
      ladyship&rsquo;s request was granted. Further than this affair of the three
      bridemaids we know not&mdash;there is no record concerning who were the
      bride-men. But before we come to the wedding-day, we think it necessary to
      mention, for the satisfaction of the prudent part of the world, that the
      settlements were duly signed, sealed, and delivered, in the presence of
      proper witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment of recording this fact, we are well aware that as much as we
      shall gain in the esteem of the old, we shall lose in the opinion of the
      young. We must therefore be satisfied with the nod of approbation from
      parents, and must endure the smile of scorn from lovers. We know that
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Jointure, portion, gold, estate,
    Houses, household-stuff, or land,
   The low conveniences of fate,
    Are Greek, no lovers understand.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      We regret that we cannot gratify some of our courteous readers with a
      detailed account of the marriage of Caroline and Count Altenberg, with a
      description of the wedding-dresses, or a list of the company, who, after
      the ceremony, partook of an elegant collation at Lady Jane Granville&rsquo;s
      house in Spring-Gardens. We lament that we cannot even furnish a paragraph
      in honour of Count Altenberg&rsquo;s equipage.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all their other friends had made their congratulations, had taken
      leave of Caroline, and had departed, Mrs. Hungerford and Mrs. Mortimer
      still lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, my love,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hungerford, &ldquo;I ought to resign you, in these
      last moments, to your parents, your brothers, your own Rosamond; yet I
      have some excuse for my selfishness&mdash;they will see you again, it is
      to be hoped, often&mdash;But I!&mdash;that is not in the course of nature:
      the blessing I scarcely could have expected to live to enjoy has been
      granted to me. And now that I have seen you united to one worthy of you,
      one who knows your value, I am content&mdash;I am grateful. Farewell,
      again and again, my beloved Caroline, may every&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears spoke the rest. Turning from Caroline, she leaned on Count
      Altenberg&rsquo;s arm; as he conducted her to her carriage, &ldquo;You are a happy
      man, Count Altenberg,&rdquo; said she: &ldquo;forgive me, if I am not able to
      congratulate you as I ought&mdash;Daughter Mortimer, you know my heart&mdash;speak
      for me, if you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg was more touched by this strong affection for Caroline
      than he could have been by any congratulatory compliments to himself.
      After the departure of Mrs. Hungerford and Mrs. Mortimer, came the
      separation so much dreaded by all the family, for which all stood
      prepared. Despising and detesting the display of sensibility, they had
      fortified themselves for this moment with all their resolution, and each
      struggled to repress their own feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Altenberg had delayed till the last moment. It was now necessary
      that they should set out. Caroline, flushed crimson to the very temples
      one instant, and pale the next, commanded with the utmost effort her
      emotion; Rosamond, unable to repress hers, clung to her sister weeping.
      Caroline&rsquo;s lips quivered with a vain attempt to speak&mdash;she could only
      embrace Rosamond repeatedly, and then her mother. Her father pressed her
      to his bosom&mdash;blessed her&mdash;and then drawing her arm within his,
      led her to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they passed through the hall, the faithful housekeeper, and the old
      steward, who had come from the country to the marriage, pressed forward,
      in hopes of a last look. Caroline stopped, and took leave of each. She was
      able, though with difficulty, to speak, and she thanked them for all the
      services and kindness she had received from them from childhood to this
      hour: then her father led her to the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the order of nature, my dear child,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;we are fond but not
      selfish parents; your happiness is gained by the sacrifice, and we can
      part with you.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some sage moralist has observed, that even in the accomplishment of our
      most ardent wishes in this world, there is always some circumstance that
      disappoints our expectations, or mixes somewhat of pain with the joy.
      &ldquo;This is perfectly true,&rdquo; thought Rosamond. &ldquo;How often have I wished for
      Caroline&rsquo;s marriage with Count Altenberg&mdash;and now she is married&mdash;really
      married&mdash;and gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had passed with the rapidity of a dream: the hurry of joy, the
      congratulations&mdash;all, all was over; and in sad silence, Rosamond felt
      the reality of her loss&mdash;by Rosamond doubly felt at this moment, when
      all her own affairs were in great uncertainty. Mr. Temple was still unable
      to obtain the performance of the promise which had been made him of <i>remuneration</i>
      and <i>competent provision</i>. He had gone through, in compliance with
      the advice of his friends, the mortification of reiterating vain memorials
      and applications to the Duke of Greenwich, Lord Skrimpshire, Lord Skreene,
      and Mr. Secretary Cope. The only thing which Mr. Temple refused to do, was
      to implicate Lord Oldborough, or to disturb him on the subject. He had
      spent some weeks with his old master in his retirement without once
      adverting to his own difficulties, still hoping that on his return to town
      a promise would be fulfilled, which Lord Skreene had given him, that &ldquo;the
      affair should in his absence be settled to his satisfaction.&rdquo; But on his
      return to town, his lordship found means of evasion and delay, and threw
      the blame on others; the course of memorials and representations was to be
      recommenced. Mr. Temple&rsquo;s pride revolted, his love was in despair&mdash;and
      frequently, in the bitterness of disappointment, he reiterated to his
      friend Alfred his exclamations of regret and self-reproach, for having
      quitted, from pique and impatience of spirit, a profession where his own
      perseverance and exertions would infallibly have rendered him by this time
      independent. Rosamond saw with sympathy and anguish the effect which these
      feelings of self-reproach, and hope delayed, produced on Mr. Temple&rsquo;s
      spirits and health. His sensibility, naturally quick, and rendered more
      acute by disappointment, seemed now continually to draw from all
      characters and events, and even from every book he opened, a moral against
      himself, some new illustration or example, which convinced him more and
      more of the folly of being a dependant on the great. He was just in this
      repentant mood, when one morning, at Mrs. Alfred Percy&rsquo;s, Rosamond heard
      him sigh deeply several times, as he was reading with great attention. She
      could not forbear asking what it was that touched him so much. He put the
      book into her hands, pointing to the following passage. &ldquo;The whole of this
      letter{1},&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is applicable to me and excellent; but this really
      seems as if it had been written for me or by me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: Letter from Mr. Williams (secretary to Lord Chancellor West)
      to Mrs. Williams.}
    </p>
    <p>
      She read,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a young man, and did not think that men were to die, or to be
      turned out . . . What was to be done now?&mdash;No money, my former patron
      in disgrace! friends that were in favour not able to serve me, or not
      willing; that is, cold, timid, careful of themselves, and indifferent to a
      man whose disappointments made him less agreeable . . . I languished on
      for three long melancholy years, sometimes a little elated; a smile, a
      kind hint, a downright promise, dealt out to me from those in whom I had
      placed some silly hopes, now and then brought a little refreshment, but
      that never lasted long; and to say nothing of the agony of being reduced
      to talk of one&rsquo;s own misfortunes and one&rsquo;s wants, and that basest and
      lowest of all conditions, the slavery of borrowing, to support an idle
      useless being&mdash;my time, for those three years, was unhappy beyond
      description. What would I have given then for a profession! . . . any
      useful profession is infinitely better than a thousand patrons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this Rosamond entirely acceded, and admired the strong good sense of
      the whole letter; but she observed to Mr. Temple, that it was very unjust,
      not only to himself, but what was of much more consequence, to <i>her</i>,
      to say that all this applied exactly to his case. &ldquo;Did Mr. Temple,&rdquo; she
      asked, &ldquo;mean to assert that she could esteem a man who was <i>an idle
      useless being</i>, a mere dependant on great men, a follower of courts?
      Could such a man have recommended himself to her father? Could such a man
      ever have been the chosen friend of her brother Alfred?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was true,&rdquo; she acknowledged, &ldquo;that this friend of her brother had made
      one mistake in early life; but who is there that can say that he has not
      in youth or age committed a single error? Mr. Temple had done one silly
      thing, to be sure, in quarrelling with his profession; but he had
      suffered, and had made amends for this afterwards, by persevering
      application to literature. There he had obtained the success he deserved.
      Gentlemen might sigh and shake their heads, but could any gentleman deny
      this? Could it be denied that Mr. Temple had distinguished himself in
      literature? Could any person deny that a political pamphlet of his
      recommended him to the notice of Lord Oldborough, one of the ablest
      statesmen in England, who made him his secretary, and whose esteem and
      confidence he afterwards acquired by his merit, and continued, in place
      and out, to enjoy?&mdash;Will any gentleman deny this?&rdquo; Rosamond added,
      that, &ldquo;in defence of <i>her brother&rsquo;s friend</i>, she could not help
      observing, that a man who had obtained the esteem of some of the first
      persons of their day, who had filled an employment of trust, that of
      secretary to a minister, with fidelity and credit, who had published three
      celebrated political pamphlets, and two volumes of moral and philosophical
      disquisitions, which, as she had heard the bookseller say, were become <i>stock
      books</i>, could not deserve to be called an <i>idle useless being</i>. To
      be born and die would not make all his history&mdash;no, such a man would
      at least be secure of honourable mention in the Biographia Britannica as a
      writer&mdash;moral&mdash;political&mdash;metaphysical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But while Rosamond thus did her utmost to support the spirits of her
      lover, her own began to fail; her vivacity was no longer natural: she felt
      every day more and more the want of her sister&rsquo;s sympathy and strength of
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letters from abroad gave no hope of Caroline&rsquo;s return&mdash;delay after
      delay occurred. No sooner had quiet been restored to the country, than
      Count Altenberg&rsquo;s father was taken ill, and his illness, after long
      uncertainty, terminated fatally.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the death of his father, the Count was involved in a variety of
      domestic business, which respect for the memory of his parent, and
      affection for surviving relations, could not allow him to leave. When all
      this had been arranged, and when all seemed preparing for their return to
      England, just when Rosamond hoped that the very next letter would announce
      the day when they would set out, the French declared war, the French
      troops were actually in motion&mdash;invasion was hourly expected&mdash;it
      was necessary to prepare for the defence of the country. At such a moment
      the Count could not quit his country or his Prince. And there was
      Caroline, in the midst of a country torn by civil war, and in the midst of
      all the horrors of revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time, to increase the anxiety of the Percy family, they learned
      that Godfrey was taken prisoner on his way home from the West Indies. The
      transport, in which his division of the regiment had embarked had been
      separated from her convoy by a gale of wind in the night, and it was
      apprehended that she had been taken by the enemy. Godfrey&rsquo;s family hoped
      for a moment that this might be a false alarm; but after enduring the
      misery of reading contradictory paragraphs and contests of the newspaper
      writers with each other for several successive days, it was at last too
      clearly established and confirmed, by official intelligence, that the
      transport was taken by a Dutch ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of these accumulating causes of anxiety, trials of another
      kind were preparing for this family, as if Fortune was determined to do
      her utmost to ruin and humble those who had despised her worshippers,
      struggled against her influence, and risen in the world in defiance of her
      power. To explain the danger which now awaited them, we must return to
      their old family enemy, Sir Robert Percy. Master of Percy-hall, and of all
      that wealth could give, he could not enjoy his prosperity, but was
      continually brooding on plans of avarice and malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since his marriage with Miss Falconer, Sir Robert Percy&rsquo;s establishment
      had become so expensive as to fret his temper continually. His tenants had
      had more and more reason to complain of their landlord, who, when any of
      his farms were out of lease, raised his rents exorbitantly, to make
      himself amends, as he said, for the extravagance of his wife. The tenants,
      who had ever disliked him as the successor and enemy of their <i>own</i>
      good and beloved landlord, now could not and attempted not to conceal
      their aversion. This renewed and increased the virulence of his dislike to
      <i>our</i> branch of the Percys, who, as he knew, were always compared <i>with
      him and his</i>, and seemed to be for ever present to the provoking
      memories of these tenants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert was disappointed hitherto in the hope for which he married, the
      hope of an heir, who should prevent the estate from returning to those
      from whom it had been wrested by his arts. Envy at seeing the rising and
      prosperous state of <i>those Percys</i>, who, in spite of their loss of
      fortune, had made their way up again through all obstacles, combined to
      increase his antipathy to his relations. His envy had been exasperated by
      the marriage of Caroline to Count Altenberg, and by the high reputation of
      her brother. He heard their praises till his soul sickened; and he was
      determined to be their destruction. He found a willing and able assistant
      in Sharpe the attorney, and they soon devised a plan worthy of their
      conjoined malice. At the time when Sir Robert had come into possession of
      Percy-hall, after the suit had been decided in his favour, he had given up
      all claim to the rents which Mr. Percy had received during the years which
      he had held the estate, and had accepted in lieu of them the improvements
      which Mr. Percy had made on the estate, and a considerable quantity of
      family plate and a collection of pictures. But now Sir Robert wrote to Mr.
      Percy without adverting to this agreement, and demanding from him the
      amount of all the rents which he had received, deducting only a certain
      sum on his own valuation for improvements. The plate and pictures, which
      he had left at Percy-hall, Sir Robert said he was willing to take in lieu
      of the debt; but an immense balance against Mr. Percy remained. In
      technical phrase, we believe, he warned Mr. Percy that Sharpe his attorney
      had directions to commence a suit against him for the <i>mesne rents</i>.
      The amount of the claim was such as it was absolutely impossible that Mr.
      Percy could pay, even by the sale of every thing he possessed in the
      world. If this claim were established, his family would be reduced to
      beggary, he must end his days in a prison, or fly his country, and take
      refuge in some foreign land. To this last extremity Sir Robert hoped to
      reduce him. In reply, however, to his insolent letter, he was surprised,
      by receiving from Mr. Percy a calm and short reply, simply saying that his
      son Alfred would take the proper steps to bring the affair to trial, and
      that he must submit to the decision of the law, whatever that might be.
      Sir Robert was mortified to the quick by finding that he could not extort
      from his victim one concession or complaint, nor one intemperate
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      But however calm and dignified was Mr. Percy&rsquo;s conduct, it could not be
      without the greatest anxiety that he awaited the event of the trial which
      was to decide his future fate and that of his whole family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The length of time which must elapse before the trial could come on was
      dreadful. Suspense was the evil they found most difficult to endure.
      Suspense may be easily borne by persons of an indolent character, who
      never expect to rule their destiny by their own genius; but to those who
      feel themselves possessed of energy and abilities to surmount obstacles
      and to brave dangers, it is torture to remain passive&mdash;to feel that
      prudence, virtue, genius avail them not&mdash;that while rapid ideas pass
      in their imagination, time moves with an unaltered pace, and compels them
      to wait, along with the herd of vulgar mortals, for knowledge of futurity.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      What has become all this time of the Falconer family?
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the marriage of Miss Falconer with Sir Robert Percy, all intercourse
      between the Falconers and our branch of the Percy family had ceased; but
      one morning, when Alfred was alone, intently considering his father&rsquo;s
      case, and the legal difficulties which threatened him, he was surprised by
      a visit from Commissioner Falconer. The commissioner looked thin, pale,
      and wretched. He began by condoling with Alfred on their mutual family
      misfortunes. Alfred received this condolence with politeness, but with a
      proud consciousness that, notwithstanding his father&rsquo;s present
      difficulties, and the total loss of fortune with which he was threatened,
      neither his father, nor any individual in his family, would change places
      with any one of the Falconers; since nothing dishonourable could be
      imputed to Mr. Percy, and since none of his misfortunes had been
      occasioned by any imprudence of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep sigh from the commissioner, at the moment these thoughts were
      passing in Alfred&rsquo;s mind, excited his compassion, for he perceived that
      the same reflections had occurred to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After taking an immoderate quantity of snuff, the commissioner went on,
      and disclaimed, in strong terms, all knowledge of his son-in-law Sir
      Robert&rsquo;s cruel conduct to his cousin. The commissioner said that Sir
      Robert Percy had, since his marriage with Bell Falconer, behaved very ill,
      and had made his wife show great ingratitude to her own family&mdash;that
      in Mrs. Falconer&rsquo;s distress, when she and Georgiana were most anxious to
      retire from town for a short time, and when Mrs. Falconer had naturally
      looked to the house of her married daughter as a sure asylum, the doors of
      Percy-hall had been actually shut against her; Sir Robert declaring, that
      he would not be involved in the difficulties and disgrace of a family who
      had taken him in to marry a girl without any fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred was perfectly convinced, both from the cordial hatred with which
      the commissioner now spoke of his son-in-law, and from Mr. Falconer&rsquo;s
      disposition, that he had nothing to do with the cruel measures which Sir
      Robert had taken against his father. Commissioner Falconer was not a
      malevolent, but a weak man&mdash;incapable of being a disinterested friend&mdash;equally
      incapable of becoming a malicious enemy. The commissioner now proceeded to
      his own affairs, and to the business of his visit. He said that he had
      been disappointed in all his hopes from the Greenwich party&mdash;that
      when <i>that sad business of Mrs. Falconer&rsquo;s came out</i>, they had seized
      this as a pretence for <i>dropping</i> him altogether&mdash;that when they
      had, by Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s retreat from office, obtained every thing they
      wanted, and had no more occasion for assistance or information, they had
      shamefully forgotten, or disowned, all their former promises to
      Cunningham. They had refused to accredit him at the court of Denmark,
      refused even to defray the expenses of his journey thither, which, in the
      style he had thought it necessary for an ambassador to travel in, had been
      considerable. Upon the hopes held out, he had taken a splendid house in
      Copenhagen, and had every day, for some weeks, been in expectation of the
      arrival of his credentials. When it was publicly known that another
      ambassador was appointed, Cunningham&rsquo;s creditors became clamorous; he
      contrived to escape from Copenhagen in the night, and was proceeding <i>incog.</i>
      in his journey homewards, when he was stopped at one of the small frontier
      towns, and was there actually detained in prison for his debts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor commissioner produced his son&rsquo;s letter, giving an account of his
      detention, and stating that, unless the money he had raised in Copenhagen
      was paid, there was no hope of his being liberated&mdash;he must perish in
      a foreign jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      We spare the reader the just reproaches which the unhappy father, at this
      moment, uttered against the son&rsquo;s duplicity. It was his fate, he said, to
      be ruined by those for whom he had been labouring and planning, night and
      day, for so many years. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; concluded Mr. Falconer, &ldquo;here am I,
      reduced to sell almost the last acre of my paternal estate&mdash;I shall
      literally have nothing left but Falconer-court, and my annuity!&mdash;Nothing!&mdash;But
      it must be done, ill as he has used me, and impossible as it is, ever,
      even at this crisis, to get the truth from him&mdash;I must pay the money:
      he is in jail, and cannot be liberated without this sum. I have here, you
      see, under the hand of the chief magistrate, sufficient proof&mdash;I will
      not, however, trouble you, my dear sir, with showing more of these letters&mdash;only
      it is a comfort to me to speak to one who will listen with some sympathy&mdash;Ah!
      sir, when out of place!&mdash;out of favour!&mdash;selling one&rsquo;s estate!&mdash;how
      people change!&mdash;But I am taking up your time. Since these lands are
      to be sold, the sooner the better. Your father, you know, is trustee to my
      marriage-settlements, and, I believe, his consent, his signature, will be
      necessary&mdash;will it not?&mdash;I am no lawyer&mdash;I really am not
      clear what <i>is</i> necessary&mdash;and my solicitor, Mr. Sharpe, I have
      dismissed: perhaps you will allow me to put the business into your hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred undertook it, and kindly told the commissioner that if he would
      send him his papers, he would, without putting him to any expense, look
      them over carefully&mdash;have all the necessary releases drawn&mdash;and
      make his title clear to any purchaser who should apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner was full of gratitude for this friendly offer, and
      immediately begged that he might leave his title-deeds. Accordingly the
      servant was desired to bring in the box which he had left in the carriage.
      The commissioner then rose to take leave, but Alfred begged he would stay
      till he had written a list of the deeds, as he made it a rule never to
      take charge of any papers, without giving a receipt for them. The
      commissioner thought this &ldquo;a superfluous delicacy between friends and
      relatives;&rdquo; but Alfred observed that relations would, perhaps, oftener
      continue friends, if in matters of business, they took care always to be
      as exact as if they were strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner looked at his watch&mdash;said he was in haste&mdash;he
      was going to wait upon Lord Somebody, from whom, in spite of all his
      experience, he expected something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find a list of the deeds, I have a notion,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in the
      box, Mr. Alfred Percy, and you need only sign it&mdash;that will be quite
      sufficient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I have compared the papers with the list, I will sign it,&rdquo; said
      Alfred: &ldquo;my clerk and I will do it as quickly as possible. Believe me, you
      cannot be in greater haste than I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner, secretly cursing Alfred&rsquo;s accuracy, and muttering
      something of the necessity for his own punctuality, was obliged to submit.
      He sat down&mdash;the clerk was sent for&mdash;the box was opened. The
      list of the papers was, as Alfred found, drawn out by Buckhurst Falconer;
      and the commissioner now recollected the time. &ldquo;Just when poor Buckhurst,&rdquo;
       said the father, with a sigh, &ldquo;was arguing with me against going into the
      church&mdash;at that time. I remember, he was desperately in love with
      your sister Caroline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, in truth,&rdquo; said Alfred, smiling, as he read over the scrawled list,
      &ldquo;this looks a little as if it were written by a man in love&mdash;here&rsquo;s
      another reason for our comparing the papers and the list.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, I took it all upon trust&mdash;I am no lawyer&mdash;I never
      looked at them&mdash;never opened the box, and am very sorry to be obliged
      to do it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The essential care, either of papers or estate, the commissioner had
      evermore neglected, while he had all his life been castle-building, or
      pursuing some phantom of fortune at court. Whilst Alfred was comparing the
      papers and the list, the commissioner went on talking of the marriage of
      Caroline with Count Altenberg, asking when they expected them to return.
      It was possible that Count Altenberg might be moved to make some
      remonstrance in favour of Cunningham; and a word or two from him to the
      Duke of Greenwich would do the business. The commissioner longed to hint
      this to Alfred, but he was so intent upon these bundles of parchment, that
      till every one of them was counted, it would be in vain to make that
      attempt: so the commissioner impatiently stood by, while the clerk went on
      calling over the papers, and Alfred, in equal strains, replying. &ldquo;Thank
      Heaven!&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;they have got to the last bundle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bundle eighteen,&rdquo; cried the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bundle eighteen,&rdquo; replied Alfred. &ldquo;How many numbers does it contain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six,&rdquo; said the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six!&mdash;no, seven, if you please,&rdquo; said Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But six in the list, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will read them over,&rdquo; said Alfred. &ldquo;No. 1. Deed of assignment to Filmer
      Griffin, Esq. No. 2. Deed of mortgage to Margaret Simpson, widow. No. 3.
      Deed of lease and release. No. 4. Lease for a year&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. 4. no such thing&mdash;stop, sir&mdash;Deed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred gave one look at the paper, and starting up, snatched it from the
      hands of his clerk, with an exclamation of joy, signed the receipt for the
      commissioner, put it into his hands, locked the box, and sat down to write
      a letter, all with such rapidity that the commissioner was struck with
      astonishment and curiosity. Notwithstanding all his impatience to be
      punctual to his own engagement, he now stood fixed to the spot, and at
      last began with &ldquo;My dear Mr. Alfred Percy, may I ask what has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear commissioner, I have found it&mdash;I have found it&mdash;the
      long-lost deed, and I am writing to my father, to tell him. Excuse me&mdash;excuse
      me if I am not able to explain farther at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner understood it all too quickly. He saw how it had happened
      through Buckhurst&rsquo;s carelessness. At the time Buckhurst had been packing
      up these papers, some of Mr. Percy&rsquo;s had been lying on the table&mdash;Buckhurst
      had been charged not to mix them with his father&rsquo;s; but he was in love,
      and did not know what he was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner began three sentences, and left them all unfinished,
      while Alfred did not hear one word of them: the first was an apology for
      Buckhurst, the second a congratulation for his good cousin Percy, the
      third was an exclamation that came from his heart. &ldquo;Good Heavens! but what
      will become of my daughter Bell and Sir Robert? I do not comprehend quite,
      my dear sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving that he was not heard by Alfred, the commissioner took up his
      hat and departed, determining that he would inquire farther from Sir
      Robert&rsquo;s solicitor concerning the probable consequences of the recovery of
      this deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred had no sooner finished his joyful letter to his father than he
      wrote to Sir Robert Percy, informing him of the recovery of the deed, and
      letting him know that he was ready to show it to whomsoever Sir Robert
      would send to his house to examine it. He made this offer to put an end at
      once to all doubts. He trusted, he said, that when Sir Robert should be
      satisfied of the existence and identity of the deed, he would stop his
      present proceedings for the recovery of the <i>mesne rents</i>, and that
      he would, without obliging his father to have farther recourse to law,
      restore to him the Percy estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this letter no answer was received for some time. At length Mr. Sharpe
      called on Alfred, and begged to see the deed. He was permitted to examine
      it in Alfred&rsquo;s presence. He noted down the date, names of the witnesses,
      and some other particulars, of which, he observed, it was necessary he
      should inform Sir Robert, before he could be satisfied as to the identity
      of the conveyance. Sharpe was particularly close and guarded in his looks
      and words during this interview; would neither admit nor deny that he was
      satisfied, and went away leaving nothing certain, but that he would write
      to Sir Robert. Alfred thought he saw that they meant to avoid giving an
      answer, in order to keep possession some months longer, till another term.
      He took all the necessary steps to bring the matter to trial immediately,
      without waiting for any answer from Sir Robert. No letter came from him,
      but Alfred received from his solicitor the following note:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am directed by Sir Robert Percy to acquaint you, in reply to yours of
      the 20th instant, that conceiving his title to the Percy estate to be no
      way affected by the instrument to which you allude therein, he cannot
      withdraw his present suit for the <i>mesne rents</i> that had been already
      received, if you proceed in an ejectment for the recovery of the aforesaid
      estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your humble servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A. Sharpe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Wednesday.</i>&rdquo;

      Alfred was surprised and alarmed by this letter. It had never occurred to
      him as possible, that Sir Robert and his counsel would attempt to stand a
      new trial in the face of this recovered deed; this was beyond all he could
      have conceived even from their effrontery and villany. He consulted Mr.
      Friend, who, after considering Sharpe&rsquo;s letter, could not devise what
      defence they intended to make, as the deed, upon most accurate
      examination, appeared duly executed, according to the provision of the
      statute of frauds. Upon the whole, Mr. Friend was of opinion that the
      letter was meant merely to alarm the plaintiffs, and to bring them to
      offer or consent to a compromise. In this opinion Alfred was confirmed the
      next day, by an interview with Sharpe, accidental on Alfred&rsquo;s part, but
      designed and prepared by the solicitor, who watched Alfred as he was
      coming out of the courts, and dogged him till he parted from some
      gentlemen with whom he was walking&mdash;then joining him, he said, in a
      voice which Mr. Allscrip might have envied for its power of setting sense
      at defiance, &ldquo;I am happy, Mr. Alfred Percy, to chance to see you to-day;
      for, with a view to put an end to litigation and difficulties, I had a few
      words to suggest&mdash;premising that I do not act or speak now, in any
      wise, as or for Sir Robert Percy, or with reference to his being my
      client, or as a solicitor in this cause, be it understood, but merely and
      solely as one gentleman to another, upon honour&mdash;and not bringing
      forward any idea to be taken advantage of hereafter, as tending to any
      thing in the shape of an offer to compromise, which, in a legal point of
      view, you know, sir, I could not be warranted to hazard for my client, and
      of consequence, which I hereby declare, I do not in any degree mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you be so good, Mr. Sharpe, to state at once what you do mean? for
      I confess I do not, in any degree, understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, sir, what I mean is, simply, and candidly, and frankly, this:
      that if I could, without compromising the interest of my client, which, as
      an honest man, I am bound not to do or appear to do, I should wish to put
      an end to this litigation between relations; and though your father thinks
      me his enemy, would convince him to the contrary, if he would allow me,
      and could point out the means of shortening this difference between
      relations, which has occasioned so much scandal; and moreover, could
      devise an accommodation, which might be agreeable to both parties, and
      save you a vast deal of trouble and vexation; possession,&rdquo; added he,
      laughing, &ldquo;being nine points of the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharpe paused, as if hoping that something would now be said by
      Alfred, that might direct him whether to advance or recede; but Alfred
      only observed, that probably the end Mr. Sharpe proposed to himself by
      speaking was to make himself understood, and that this desirable end he
      had not yet attained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sir, in some cases, one cannot venture to make one&rsquo;s self understood
      any way, but by inuendoes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, good morning to you, sir&mdash;you and I can never understand one
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, sir, unless you are in a hurry,&rdquo; cried Mr. Sharpe, catching
      Alfred by the button, &ldquo;which (when so large an estate, to which you might
      eventually succeed, is in question) you are too much a man of business to
      be&mdash;in one word, then, for I won&rsquo;t detain you another moment, and I
      throw myself open, and trust to your honour&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do me honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put a parallel case. You, plaintiff A&mdash;&mdash;, I, defendant B&mdash;&mdash;.
      I should, if I were A&mdash;&mdash;, but no way advising it, being B&mdash;&mdash;,
      offer to divide the whole property, the claim for the <i>mesne rents</i>
      being wholly given up; and that the offer would be accepted, I&rsquo;d engage
      upon my honour, supposing myself witnessing the transaction, only just as
      a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible, sir,&rdquo; cried Alfred, with indignation. &ldquo;Do you take me for a
      fool? Do you think I would give up half my father&rsquo;s estate, knowing that
      he has a right to the whole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, sir&mdash;I only suggested an A. B. case. But one word more,
      sir,&rdquo; cried Mr. Sharpe, holding Alfred, who was breaking from him, &ldquo;for
      your own&mdash;your father&rsquo;s interest: you see this thing quite in a wrong
      point of view; when you talk of a few months&rsquo; more or less delay of
      getting possession, being all there is between us&mdash;depend upon it, if
      it goes to trial you will never get possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sir, if you think so, you are betraying the interest of your
      client, in advising me not to let it go to trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! sir: but that is between you and me only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, sir, it is between you and your conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if that&rsquo;s all&mdash;my conscience is at ease, when I&rsquo;m trying to
      prevent the scandal of litigation between relations: therefore, just let
      me mention to you for your private information, what I know Sir Robert
      would not wish to come out before the trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell it to me, sir&mdash;I will not hear it,&rdquo; cried Alfred,
      breaking from him, and walking on very fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faster still Sharpe pursued. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll remember, sir, at all events, that
      what has been said is not to go further&mdash;you&rsquo;ll not forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never forget that I am a man of honour, sir,&rdquo; said Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sharpe parted from him, muttering, &ldquo;that if he lived to the day of trial,
      he would repent this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I live till the day of judgment, I shall never repent it,&rdquo; thought
      Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now fully convinced that Sir Robert desired a compromise, and wanted only
      to secure, while in possession, some portion of that property, which he
      knew the law would ultimately force him to relinquish, Alfred persevered
      in his course, relieved from the alarm into which he had at first been
      thrown, when he learned that his opponents intended to make a defence.
      Alfred felt assured that they would never let the matter come to trial;
      but time passed on, and they still persisted. Many of his brother lawyers
      were not only doubtful, but more inclined to despond than to encourage him
      as to the event of the trial; several regretted that he had not accepted
      of Mr. Sharpe&rsquo;s offered compromise. &ldquo;Half the estate certain, and his
      father&rsquo;s release from all difficulties, they thought too good offers to
      have been rejected. He might, as Sharpe had prophesied, have to repent his
      rejection of that proposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Others observed, that though Mr. Alfred Percy was certainly a young man of
      great talents, and had been successful at the bar, still he was a young
      lawyer; and it was a bold and hazardous, not to say rash thing, to take
      upon himself the conduct of a suit against such opponents as Mr. Sharpe
      and Sir Robert Percy, practised in law, hardened in iniquity, and now
      driven to desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Friend was the only man who stood steadily by Alfred, and never
      wavered in his opinion. &ldquo;Trust to truth and justice,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you did
      right not to compromise&mdash;be firm. If you fail, you will have this
      consolation&mdash;you will have done all that man could do to deserve
      success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day of trial approached. Mr. Friend had hoped, till very late in the
      business, that the object of their adversaries was only to intimidate, and
      that they would never let it go to trial: now it was plain they would. But
      on what grounds? Again and again Mr. Friend and Alfred perused and
      reperused Sir John Percy&rsquo;s deed, and examined the opinions of counsel of
      the first eminence. Both law and right appeared to be clearly on their
      side; but it was not likely that their experienced opponents should
      persist without having some strong resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dread silence was preserved by Sir Robert Percy and by Mr. Solicitor
      Sharpe. They must have some deep design: what it could be, remained to be
      discovered even till the day of trial.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day of trial arrived&mdash;Mr. Percy came up to town, and brought Mrs.
      Percy and Rosamond with him to his son Alfred&rsquo;s, that they might all be
      together, and hear as soon as possible their fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial came on about three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. The court was
      uncommonly crowded. Mr. Percy, his son Erasmus, and all his friends, and
      Sir Robert and his adherents, appeared on opposite sides of the galleries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The excellent countenance and gentlemanlike demeanour of Mr. Percy were
      contrasted with the dark, inauspicious physiognomy of Sir Robert, who sat
      opposite to him, and who was never tranquil one second, but was
      continually throwing notes to his counsel, beckoning or whispering to his
      attorney&mdash;while convulsive twitches of face and head, snuff-taking,
      and handkerchief spread frequently to conceal the expression of his
      countenance, betrayed the malignant flurry of his spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred conducted his father&rsquo;s cause in the most judicious and temperate
      manner. An attempt had been made by Sir Robert to prejudice the public
      against Mr. Percy, by representing him as the descendant of a younger
      brother, who was endeavouring to dispossess the heir of the elder branch
      of the family of that estate, which belonged to him by right of
      inheritance. Alfred&rsquo;s fast care was to put the court and the jury in full
      possession of the facts. He stated that &ldquo;His father, Lewis Percy,
      plaintiff in this cause, and Robert Percy, Bart. defendant, both descended
      from Sir John Percy, who was their grandfather. Sir John outlived both his
      sons, who left him two grandsons, Robert was the son of his eldest, and
      Lewis of his youngest son. Sir John had two estates, one of them paternal,
      which went in the ordinary course of descent to the representative of the
      eldest son, being the present Sir Robert Percy. Sir John&rsquo;s other estate,
      in Hampshire, which came to him by his wife, he conveyed, a short time
      before his death, to his youngest grandson, the present Lewis Percy, who
      had held undisturbed possession of it for many years. But, in process of
      time, Sir Robert Percy ruined himself by play, and having frequent
      intercourse with Sharpe, the solicitor, upon some great emergency inquired
      whether it was not possible to shake the title of his cousin Mr. Percy&rsquo;s
      estate. He suggested that the conveyance might not be forthcoming; but Sir
      Robert assured him that both his grandfather and the present Mr. Percy
      were men of business, and that there was little likelihood either that the
      deeds should be lost, or that there should be any flaw in the title.
      Afterwards a fire broke out at Percy-hall, which consumed that wing of the
      house in which were Mr. Percy&rsquo;s papers&mdash;the papers were all saved
      except this deed of conveyance. Mr. Sharpe being accidentally apprized of
      the loss, conveyed the intelligence to Sir Robert. He immediately
      commenced a suit against his cousin, and had finally succeeded in
      obtaining a verdict in his own favour, and possession of the Hampshire
      estate. At the time when Mr. Percy delivered up possession and quitted
      Percy-hall, in consideration of the extensive improvements which he had
      made, and in consideration of his giving up to Sir Robert plate,
      furniture, wine, horses, and equipages, Sir Robert had promised to forego
      whatever claim he might have upon Mr. Percy for the rents which he had
      received during the time he had held the estate; but, afterwards, Sir
      Robert repented of having made this agreement, broke his promise, and took
      out a writ against his cousin for the <i>mesne rents</i>. They amounted to
      an immense sum, which Mr. Percy was utterly unable to pay, and he could
      have had no hope of avoiding ruin, had the claim been by law decided
      against him. By fortunate circumstances, however, he had, while this cause
      was pending, recovered that lost conveyance, which proved his right to the
      Hampshire estate. Of this he had apprized Sir Robert, who had persisted,
      nevertheless, in holding possession, and in his claim for the <i>mesne
      rents</i>. The present action was brought by Mr. Percy in resistance of
      this unjust claim, and for the recovery of his property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not one word of invective, of eloquence, of ornament, or of any attempt at
      pathos, did our barrister mix with this statement. It was his object to
      put the jury and the court clearly in possession of facts, which,
      unadorned, he knew would appear stronger than if encumbered by any flowers
      of oratory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having produced the deed, conveying the Hampshire estate to his father,
      Alfred called evidence to prove the signature of Sir John Percy, and the
      handwriting of the witnesses. He farther proved that this conveyance had
      been formerly seen among his father&rsquo;s papers at Percy-hall, showed it had
      been recently recovered from Mr. Falconer&rsquo;s box of papers, and explained
      how it had been put there by mistake, and he supported this fact by the
      evidence of Commissioner Falconer, father-in-law to the defendant.&mdash;Alfred
      rested his cause on these proofs, and waited, anxious to know what defence
      the defendant was prepared to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his astonishment and consternation, Sir Robert&rsquo;s counsel produced
      another deed of Sir John Percy&rsquo;s, revoking the deed by which Sir John had
      made over his Hampshire estate to his younger grandson, Mr. Percy; it
      appearing by a clause in the original deed that a power for this purpose
      had been therein reserved. This deed of revocation was handed to the judge
      and to the jury, that it might be examined. The two deeds were carefully
      compared. The nicest inspection could not discover any difference in the
      signature or seal. When Mr. Friend examined them, he was in dismay. The
      instrument appeared perfect. Whilst the jury were occupied in this
      examination, Mr. Friend and Alfred had a moment to consult together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are undone,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Friend, &ldquo;if they establish this deed of
      revocation&mdash;it sets us aside for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither Mr. Friend nor Alfred had any doubt of its being a forgery, but
      those, who had plunged thus desperately in guilt, would probably be
      provided with perjury sufficient to support their iniquity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we had been prepared!&rdquo; said Mr. Friend: &ldquo;but how could we be prepared
      for such a stroke? Even now, if we had time, we could summon witnesses who
      would discredit theirs, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not despair,&rdquo; said Alfred: &ldquo;still we have a chance that their own
      witnesses may cross each other, or contradict themselves. Falsehood, with
      all its caution, is seldom consistent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The trial proceeded. Alfred, in the midst of the fears and sighs of his
      friends, and of the triumphant smiles and anticipating congratulations of
      his enemies, continued to keep both his temper and his understanding cool.
      His attention was fixed upon the evidence produced, regardless of the
      various suggestions whispered or written to him by ignorant or learned
      advisers.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Clerke, the only surviving witness to the deed of revocation
      produced by Sir Robert, was the person on whose evidence this cause
      principally rested. He was now summoned to appear, and room was made for
      him. He was upwards of eighty years of age: he came slowly into court, and
      stood supporting himself upon his staff, his head covered with thin gray
      hairs, his countenance placid and smiling, and his whole appearance so
      respectable, so venerable, as to prepossess, immediately, the jury and the
      court in his favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred Percy could scarcely believe it possible, that such a man as this
      could be the person suborned to support a forgery. After being sworn, he
      was desired to sit down, which he did, bowing respectfully to the court.
      Sir Robert Percy&rsquo;s counsel proceeded to examine him as to the points they
      desired to establish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name, sir, is William Clerke, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is William Clerke,&rdquo; answered the old man, in a feeble voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see this paper before?&rdquo; showing him the deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did&mdash;I was present when Sir John Percy signed it&mdash;he bid me
      witness it, that is, write my name at the bottom, which I did, and then he
      said, &lsquo;Take notice, William Clerke, this is a deed, revoking the deed by
      which I made over my Hampshire estate to my youngest grandson, Lewis
      Percy.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The witness was going on, but the counsel interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw Sir John Percy sign this deed&mdash;you are sure of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this Sir John Percy&rsquo;s signature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is&mdash;the very same I saw him write; and here is my own name, that
      he bid me put just there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can swear that this is your handwriting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&mdash;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you recollect what time Sir John Percy signed this deed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; about three or four days before his death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, that is all we want of you, Mr. Clerke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred Percy desired that Clerke should be detained in court, that he
      might cross-examine him. The defendants went on, produced their evidence,
      examined all their witnesses, and established all they desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it came to Alfred&rsquo;s turn to cross-examine the witnesses that had been
      produced by his adversary. When William Clerke re-appeared, Alfred
      regarding him stedfastly, the old man&rsquo;s countenance changed a little; but
      still he looked prepared to stand a cross-examination. In spite of all his
      efforts, however, he trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you are trembling on the brink of the grave!&rdquo; said Alfred, addressing
      him in a low, solemn tone: &ldquo;pause, and reflect, whilst you are allowed a
      moment&rsquo;s time. A few years must be all you have to spend in this world. A
      few moments may take you to another, to appear before a higher tribunal&mdash;before
      that Judge, who knows our hearts, who sees into yours at this instant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The staff in the old man&rsquo;s hand shook violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert Percy&rsquo;s counsel interrupted&mdash;said that the witness should
      not be intimidated, and appealed to the court. The judge was silent, and
      Alfred proceeded, &ldquo;You know that you are upon your oath&mdash;these are
      possibly the last words you may ever utter&mdash;look that they be true.
      You know that men have been struck dead whilst uttering falsehoods. You
      are upon your oath&mdash;did you see Sir John Percy sign this deed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man attempted in vain to articulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him time to recollect,&rdquo; cried the counsel on the opposite side:
      &ldquo;give him leave to see the writing now he has his spectacles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the writing twice&mdash;his head and hands shaking so that he
      could not fix his spectacles. The question was repeated by the judge. The
      old man grew pale as death. Sir Robert Percy, just opposite to him,
      cleared his throat to catch the witness&rsquo;s attention, then darted at him
      such a look as only he could give.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I see Sir John Percy sign this deed?&rdquo; repeated William Clerke: &ldquo;yes,
      I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear, my lord, you hear,&rdquo; cried Sir Robert&rsquo;s counsel, &ldquo;the witness
      says he did&mdash;there is no occasion farther to intimidate this poor old
      man. He is not used to speak before such an audience. There is no need of
      eloquence&mdash;all we want is truth. The evidence is positive. My lord,
      with your lordship&rsquo;s leave, I fancy we may dismiss him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were going to hurry him away, but Alfred Percy said that, with the
      permission of the court, he must cross-examine that witness farther, as
      the whole event of the trial depended upon the degree of credit that might
      be given to his evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the old man had somewhat recovered himself; he saw that his
      age and reverend appearance still prepossessed the jury in his favour, and
      from their looks, and from the whispers near him, he learned that his
      tremor and hesitation had not created any suspicion of guilt, but had been
      attributed rather to the sensibility of virtue, and the weakness of age.
      And, now that the momentary emotion which eloquence had produced on his
      mind had subsided, he recollected the bribe that had been promised to him.
      He was aware that he had already sworn what, if he contradicted, might
      subject him to be prosecuted for perjury. He now stood obstinately
      resolved to persevere in his iniquity. The first falsehoods pronounced and
      believed, the next would be easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name is William Clerke, and this,&rdquo; said Alfred (pointing to the
      witness&rsquo;s signature), &ldquo;is your handwriting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I say it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>can</i> write then?&rdquo; (putting a pen into his hand) &ldquo;be so good as
      to write a few words in the presence of the court.&rdquo; He took the pen, but
      after making some fruitless attempts, replied, &ldquo;I am too old to write&mdash;I
      have not been able to write my name these many years&mdash;Indeed! sir,
      indeed! you are too hard upon one like me. God knows,&rdquo; said he, looking up
      to Heaven, some thought with feeling, some suspected with hypocrisy&mdash;&ldquo;God
      knows, sir, I speak the truth, and nothing but the truth. Have you any
      more questions to put to me? I am ready to tell all I know. What interest
      have I to conceal any thing?&rdquo; continued he, his voice gaining strength and
      confidence as he went on repeating the lesson which he had been taught.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was long, a long while ago,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;since it had all happened; but
      thank Heaven, his memory had been spared him, and he remembered all that
      had passed, the same as if it was but yesterday. He recollected how Sir
      John looked, where he sat, what he said when he signed this deed; and,
      moreover, he had often before heard of a dislike Sir John had taken to his
      younger grandson&mdash;ay, to that young gentleman&rsquo;s father,&rdquo; looking at
      Alfred; &ldquo;and I was very sorry to hear it&mdash;very sorry there should be
      any dispute in the family, for I loved them all,&rdquo; said he, wiping his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;ay,
      I loved &lsquo;em all, and all alike, from the time they were in their cradles.
      I remember too, once, Sir John said to me, &lsquo;William Clerke,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;you
      are a faithful lad&rsquo;&mdash;for I was a lad once&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred had judiciously allowed the witness to go on as far as he pleased
      with his story, in the expectation that some exaggeration and
      contradiction would appear; but the judge now interrupted the old man,
      observing that this was nothing to the purpose&mdash;that he must not take
      up the time of the court with idle tales, but that if he had any thing
      more to give in evidence respecting the deed, he should relate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge was thought to be severe; and the old man, after glancing his
      eye on the jury, bowed with an air of resignation, and an appearance of
      difficulty, which excited their compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may let him go now, my lord, may not we?&rdquo; said Sir Robert Percy&rsquo;s
      counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the permission of his lordship, I will ask one other question,&rdquo; said
      Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it should be observed, that after the first examination of this
      witness, Alfred had heard him say to Mr. Sharpe, &ldquo;They forgot to bring out
      what I had to say about the seal.&rdquo; To which Sharpe had replied, &ldquo;Enough
      without it.&rdquo; Alfred had examined the seal, and had observed that there was
      something underneath it&mdash;through a small hole in the parchment he saw
      something between the parchment and the sealing-wax.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were present, I think you say, Mr. Clerke, not only when this deed
      was signed, but when it was sealed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was, sir,&rdquo; cried Clerke, eager to bring out this part of the evidence,
      as it had been prepared for him by Sir Robert; &ldquo;I surely was; and I
      remember it particularly, because of a little remarkable circumstance: Sir
      John, God bless him!&mdash;I think I see him now&mdash;My lord, under this
      seal,&rdquo; continued the old man, addressing himself to the judge, and putting
      his shrivelled finger upon the seal, &ldquo;under this very seal Sir John put a
      sixpence&mdash;and he called upon me to observe him doing it&mdash;for, my
      lord, it is my opinion, he thought then of what might come to pass&mdash;he
      had a sort of a foreboding of this day. And now, my lord, order them, if
      you please, to break the seal&mdash;break it before them all,&mdash;and if
      there is not the sixpence under it, why this deed is not Sir John&rsquo;s, and
      this is none of my writing, and,&rdquo; cried he, lifting up his hands and eyes,
      &ldquo;I am a liar, and perjured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a profound silence. The seal was broken. The sixpence appeared.
      It was handed in triumph, by Sir Robert Percy&rsquo;s counsel, to the jury and
      to the judge. There seemed to be no longer a doubt remaining in the minds
      of the jury&mdash;and a murmur of congratulation among the partisans of
      Sir Robert seemed to anticipate the verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis all over, I fear,&rdquo; whispered Friend to Alfred. &ldquo;Alfred, you have
      done all that could be done, but they have sworn through every thing&mdash;it
      is over with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Alfred. Every eye turned upon him, some from pity, some
      from curiosity, to see how he bore his defeat. At length, when there was
      silence, he begged to be permitted to look at the sixpence. The judge
      ordered that it should be shown to him. He held it to the light to examine
      the date of the coin; he discovered a faint impression of a head on the
      sixpence, and, upon closer inspection, he made out the date, and showed
      clearly that the date of the coin was later than the date of the deed: so
      that there was an absolute impossibility that this sixpence could have
      been put under the seal of the deed by Sir John.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment Alfred stated this fact, the counsel on the opposite side took
      the sixpence, examined it, threw down his brief, and left the court.
      People looked at each other in astonishment. The judge ordered that
      William Clerke should be detained, that he might be prosecuted by the
      crown for perjury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man fell back senseless. Mr. Sharpe and Sir Robert Percy pushed
      their way together out of court, disclaimed by all who had till now
      appeared as their friends. No farther evidence was offered, so that here
      the trial closed. The judge gave a short, impressive charge to the jury,
      who, without withdrawing, instantly gave their verdict in favour of the
      plaintiff, Lewis Percy&mdash;a verdict that was received with loud
      acclamations, which not even respect to the court could restrain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy and Alfred hastily shook hands with their friends, and in the
      midst of universal applause hurried away to carry the good news to Mrs.
      Percy and Rosamond, who were at Alfred&rsquo;s house, waiting to hear the event
      of the trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Alfred nor Mr. Percy had occasion to speak&mdash;the moment Mrs.
      Percy and Rosamond saw them they knew the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Percy, &ldquo;our fortune is restored; and doubly happy we are,
      in having regained it, in a great measure, by the presence of mind and
      ability of my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mother and sister embraced Alfred with tears of delight. For some
      moments a spectator might have imagined that he beheld a family in deep
      affliction. But soon through these tears appeared on the countenance of
      each individual the radiance of joy, smiles of affection, tenderness,
      gratitude, and every delightful benignant feeling of the human heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has any body sent to Mrs. Hungerford and to Lady Jane Granville?&rdquo; said
      Mr. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, messengers were sent off the moment the verdict was given,&rdquo;
       said Erasmus: &ldquo;I took care of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pity,&rdquo; said Rosamond, &ldquo;that Caroline is not here at this moment,
      and Godfrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is best as it is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Percy: &ldquo;we have that pleasure still in
      store.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, my beloved children,&rdquo; said Mr. Percy, &ldquo;after having returned
      thanks to Providence, let me here, in the midst of all of you to whom I
      owe so large a share of my happiness, sit down quietly for a few minutes
      to enjoy &lsquo;the sober certainty of waking bliss.&rsquo;&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day after the trial brought several happy letters to the Percys.
      Rosamond called it the day of happy letters, and by that name it was ever
      after recorded in the family. The first of these letters was from Godfrey,
      as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear father, mother, brothers, and sisters all! I hope you are not under
      any anxiety about me, for here I am, safe and sound, and in excellent
      quarters, at the house of Mynheers Grinderweld, Groensveld, and
      Slidderschild, Amsterdam, the Dutch merchants who were shipwrecked on our
      coast years ago! If it had happened yesterday, the thing could not be
      fresher in their memories. My dear Rosamond, when we laughed at their
      strange names, square figures, and formal advice to us, if ever we should,
      by the changes and chances of human events, be reduced to distress, we
      little thought that I, a prisoner, should literally come to seek shelter
      at their door. And most hospitably have I been received. National
      prejudices, which I early acquired, I don&rsquo;t know how, against the Dutch,
      made me fancy that a Dutchman could think only of himself, and would give
      nothing for nothing: I can only say from experience, I have been as
      hospitably treated in Amsterdam as ever I was in London. These honest
      merchants have overwhelmed me with civilities and substantial services,
      and still they seem to think they can never do enough for me. I wish I may
      ever see them on English ground again. But we have no Percy-hall to
      receive them in now; and as well as I remember the Hills, we could not
      conveniently stow more than one at a time. Side by side, as they stood
      after breakfast, I recollect, at Percy-hall, they would completely fill up
      the parlour at the Hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may well be in high spirits to-day; for these good people have just
      been telling me, that the measures they have been taking to get my
      exchange effected, have so far succeeded, they have reason to believe that
      in a week, or a fortnight at farthest, I shall be under weigh for England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the mean time, you will wonder perhaps how I got here; for I perceive
      that I have subjected myself to Rosamond&rsquo;s old reproach of never beginning
      my story at the beginning. My father used to say, half the mistakes in
      human affairs arise from our <i>taking for granted</i>; but I think I may
      take it for granted, that either from the newspapers or from Gascoigne,
      who must be in England by this time, you have learned that the transport I
      was on board, with my division of the regiment, parted convoy in the storm
      of the 18th, in the night, and at daybreak fell in with two Dutchmen. Our
      brave boys fought as Englishmen always do; but all that is over now, so it
      does not signify prosing about it. Two to one was too much&mdash;we were
      captured. I had not been five minutes on the Dutchman&rsquo;s deck, when I
      observed one of the sailors eyeing me very attentively. Presently he came
      up and asked if my name was not Percy, and if I did not recollect to have
      seen him before? He put me in mind of the shipwreck, and told me he was
      one of the sailors who were harboured in one of my father&rsquo;s outhouses
      whilst they were repairing the wreck. I asked him what had become of the
      drunken carpenter, and told him the disaster that ensued in consequence of
      that rascal&rsquo;s carelessness. My sailor was excessively shocked at the
      account of the fire at Percy-hall: he thumped his breast till I thought he
      would have broken his breast-bone; and after relieving his mind by cursing
      and swearing in high Dutch, low Dutch, and English, against the drunken
      carpenter, he told me there was no use in saying any more, for that he had
      punished himself.&mdash;He was found dead one morning behind a barrel,
      from which in the night he had been drinking spirits surreptitiously
      through a straw. Pray tell this to old John, who used always to prophesy
      that this fellow would come to no good: assure him, however, at the same
      time, that all the Dutch sailors do not deserve his maledictions. Tell
      him, I can answer for the poor fellow who recognized me, and who, during
      the whole passage, never failed to show me and my fellow-prisoners every
      little attention in his power. When we got to Amsterdam, it was he
      reminded me of the Dutch merchants, told me their names, which, without
      his assistance, I might have perished before I could ever have
      recollected, and showed me the way to their house, and never rested till
      he saw me well settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will expect from me some account of this place. You need not expect
      any, for just as I had got to this line in my letter appeared one who has
      put all the lions of Amsterdam fairly out of my head&mdash;Mr. Gresham! He
      has been for some weeks in the country, and has just returned. The Dutch
      merchants, not knowing of his being acquainted with my family, never
      mentioned him to me, nor me to him: so our surprise at meeting was great.
      What pleasure it is in a foreign country, and to a poor prisoner, to see
      any one from dear England, and one who knows our own friends! I had never
      seen Mr. Gresham myself, but you have all by your letters made me well
      acquainted with him. I like him prodigiously, to use a lady&rsquo;s word (not
      yours, Rosamond). Letters from Mr. Henry were waiting for him here; he has
      just opened them, and the first news he tells me is, that Caroline is
      going to be married! Is it possible? Count Altenberg! The last time I
      heard from you, you mentioned nothing of all this. Some of your letters
      must have been lost. Pray write again immediately, and do not take it for
      granted that I shall be at home before a letter reaches me; but give me a
      full history of every thing up to the present moment. Groensveld is
      sealing his letters for London, and must have mine now or never. Adieu!
      Pray write fully: you cannot be too minute for a poor prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours affectionately,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;burning with curiosity,
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;GODFREY PERCY.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      A letter from Mr. Gresham to Mr. Henry farther informed them, that
      Godfrey&rsquo;s exchange was actually effected, and that he had secured his
      passage on board a vessel just ready to sail for England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next came letters from Count Altenberg. Briefly, in the laconic style of a
      man pressed at once by sudden events and strong feelings, he related that
      at the siege of the city of &mdash;&mdash; by the French, early in the
      morning of the day on which it was expected that the enemy would attempt
      to storm the place, his prince, while inspecting the fortifications, was
      killed by a cannon-ball, on the very spot where the Count had been
      standing but a moment before. All public affairs were changed in his
      country by the death of the prince. His successor, of a weak character,
      was willing to purchase present ease, and to secure his low pleasures, at
      any price&mdash;ready to give up the honour of his country, and submit to
      the conqueror&mdash;that he had been secretly intriguing with the enemy,
      had been suspected, and this suspicion was confirmed by his dastardly
      capitulation when the means of defence were in his power and the spirit of
      his people eager for resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      With indignation, heightened by grief, contrast, and despairing
      patriotism, Count Altenberg had remonstrated in vain&mdash;had refused, as
      minister, to put his signature to the capitulation&mdash;had been
      solicited urgently to concede&mdash;offers of wealth and dignities pressed
      upon him: these he rejected with scorn. Released from all his public
      engagements by the death of the prince, and by the retiring of the
      princess from court, Count Altenberg refused to act as minister under his
      successor; and seeing that, under such a successor to the government, no
      means of serving or saving the country remained, he at once determined to
      quit it for ever: resolved to live in a free country, already his own,
      half by birth and wholly by inclination, where he had property sufficient
      to secure him independence, sufficient for his own wishes, and for those
      of his beloved Caroline&mdash;a country where he could enjoy better than
      on any other spot in the whole compass of the civilized world, the
      blessings of real liberty and of domestic tranquillity and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      His decision made, it was promptly executed. He left to a friend the
      transacting the sale of his German property, and Caroline concluded his
      letter with
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR FRIENDS,
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passports are obtained, every thing ready. Early next week we set out for
      England; by the first of next month we shall be at HOME.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came a letter from Lord Oldborough. Some time previously to the
      trial, surprised at neither seeing Mr. Temple nor hearing of his marriage,
      his lordship had written to inquire what delayed his promised return.
      Taking it for granted that he was married, his lordship in the most polite
      manner begged that he would prevail upon his bride to enliven the
      retirement of an old statesman by her sprightly company. As the friend of
      her father he made this request, with a confidence in her hereditary
      disposition to show him kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply to this letter, Mr. Temple told his friend and master what had
      delayed his marriage, and why he had hitherto forborne to trouble him on
      the subject. Lord Oldborough, astonished and indignant, uttered once and
      but once contemptuous exclamations against the &ldquo;inconceivable meanness of
      Lord Skrimpshire,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;infinitely small mind of his grace of
      Greenwich;&rdquo; then, without condescending to any communication with inferior
      powers, his lordship applied directly to the highest authority. The
      consequence was that a place double the value of that which had been
      promised was given to Mr. Temple, and it was to announce his appointment
      to it that occasioned the present letter from Lord Oldborough, enclosing
      one from Mr. Secretary Cope, who &ldquo;had it in command to assure his lordship
      that the delay had arisen solely from the anxious desire of his majesty&rsquo;s
      ministers to mark their respect for his lordship&rsquo;s recommendation, and
      their sense of Mr. Temple&rsquo;s merit, by doing more than had been originally
      proposed. An opportunity, for which they had impatiently waited, had now
      put it into their power to evince the sincerity of their intentions in a
      mode which they trusted would prove to the entire satisfaction of his
      lordship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The greatest care was taken both in substance and manner to gratify Lord
      Oldborough, whose loss had been felt, and whose value had, upon
      comparison, increased in estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamond was rewarded by seeing the happiness of the man she loved, and
      hearing him declare that he owed it to her prudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosamond&rsquo;s prudence!&mdash;Whoever expected to hear this?&rdquo; Mr. Percy
      exclaimed. &ldquo;And yet the praise is just. So, henceforward, none need ever
      despair of grafting prudence upon generosity of disposition and vivacity
      of temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Temple obtained from Rosamond a promise to be his, as soon as her
      sister Caroline and her brother should arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane Granville, who felt the warmest interest in their prosperity,
      was the first to whom they communicated all this joyful intelligence. Her
      ladyship&rsquo;s horses had indeed reason to rue this day; for they did more
      work this day than London horses ever accomplished before in the same
      number of hours, not excepting even those of the merciless Mrs. John
      Prevost; for Lady Jane found it necessary to drive about to her thousand
      acquaintance to spread the news of the triumph and felicity of the Percy
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this tumult of joy, Mr. Percy wrote two letters: one was
      to his faithful old steward, John Nelson, who deserved from his master
      this mark of regard; the other was to Commissioner Falconer, to make him
      some friendly offers of assistance in his own affairs, and to beg that,
      through him, his daughter, the unhappy and deserted lady of Sir Robert
      Percy, might be assured that neither Mr. Percy nor any of his family
      wished to put her to inconvenience; and that far from being in haste to
      return to Percy-hall, they particularly wished to wait in town for the
      arrival of Caroline and Count Altenberg; and they therefore requested that
      she would not hasten her removal, from any false idea of their impatience.
      We said the deserted lady of Sir Robert Percy, for Sir Robert had fled
      from the country. On quitting the court after the trial, he took all the
      ready money he had previously collected from his tenants, and set out for
      the continent, leaving a note for his wife, apprizing her &ldquo;that she would
      never see him more, and that she had better return to her father and
      mother, as he had no means left to support her extravagance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Commissioner Falconer was at this time at Falconer-court, where he had
      been obliged to go to settle some business with his tenantry, previously
      to the sale of his land for the redemption of Cunningham. The
      Commissioner&rsquo;s answer to Mr. Percy&rsquo;s letter was as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you, my dear sir, how much I was touched by the kindness of
      your letter and conduct&mdash;so different from what I have met with from
      others. I will not cloud your happiness&mdash;in which, believe me, I
      heartily rejoice&mdash;by the melancholy detail of all my own sorrows and
      disappointments; but only answer briefly to your friendly inquiries
      respecting my affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And first, for my unfortunate married daughter, who has been in this
      terrible manner returned upon our hands. She thanks you for your
      indulgence, on which she will not encroach. Before you receive this, she
      will have left Percy-hall. She is going to live with a Miss Clapham, a
      great heiress, who wants a fashionable companion and chaperon. Mrs.
      Falconer became acquainted with her at Tunbridge, and has devised this
      plan for Arabella. I fear Bell&rsquo;s disposition will not suit such a
      situation, but she has no other resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Falconer and Georgiana have so <i>over-managed</i> matters with
      respect to Petcalf, that it has ended, as I long since feared it would, in
      his breaking off. If Mrs. Falconer had taken my advice, Georgiana might
      now be completely settled; instead of which she is fitting out for India.
      She is going, to be sure, in good company; but in my opinion the expense
      (which, Heaven knows, I can ill afford) will be thrown away like all the
      rest&mdash;for Georgiana has been much worn by late hours, and though
      still young, has, I fear, lost her bloom, and looks rather old for India.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am truly obliged to you, my dear sir, for your friendly offer with
      respect to Falconer-court, and have in consequence stopped the sale of the
      furniture. I shall rejoice to have such a good tenant as Mr. Temple. It is
      indeed much more agreeable to me to let than to sell. The accommodation,
      as you propose, will put it in my power to release Cunningham, which is my
      most pressing difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you are the only person in the world now who takes an interest in my
      affairs, or to whom I can safely unburden my mind, I must, though I know
      complaint to be useless, relieve my heart by it for a moment. I can safely
      say, that for the last ten years of my life I have never spent a day <i>for
      myself</i>. I have been continually planning and toiling to advance my
      family,&mdash;not an opportunity has been neglected; and yet from this
      very family springs all my unhappiness. Even Mrs. Falconer blames me as
      the cause of that <i>sad business</i>, which has disgraced us for ever,
      and deprived us of all our friends&mdash;and has afforded an excuse for
      breaking all promises. There are many, whom I will not name, but they are
      persons now high in office, who have&mdash;I may venture to say it to you&mdash;used
      me shamefully ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many an honest tradesman and manufacturer, to say nothing of men of
      talents in the liberal professions, I have seen in the course of the last
      forty years make their own fortunes, and large fortunes, while I have
      ended worse than I began&mdash;have literally been working all my life for
      others, not only without reward, but without thanks. If I were to begin
      life again, I certainly should follow your principles, my dear sir, and
      depend more upon myself and less upon others, than I have done&mdash;But
      now all is over. Let me assure you, that in the midst of my own
      misfortunes, I rejoice in your prosperity, and in the esteem and respect
      with which I hear you and yours spoken of by all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Present my affectionate regards and congratulations to Mrs. Percy, and to
      all your amiable and happy circle. Propriety and feeling for my poor
      daughter, Lady Percy, must prevent my paying at present my personal
      congratulations to you at Percy-hall; but I trust you will not the less
      believe in the sincerity of my attachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, my dear sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your obliged and faithful
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend and servant,
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;T. FALCONER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;I have just learnt that the little place I mentioned to Mr.
      Alfred Percy, when we last met, is not disposed of. Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s
      influence, as Mr. Temple well knows, is still all-powerful; and your
      interest with his lordship, you must be sensible, is greater than that of
      any other person living, without exception. A word from you would do the
      business for me. It is but a trifle, which I should once have been ashamed
      to ask: but it is now a matter of necessity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The event of the trial, and the restoration of the Percy family to their
      property, were heard with transports of joy by the old tenantry. They had
      not needed the effect of contrast, to make them love and feel the value of
      their good landlord; but certainly Sir Robert Percy&rsquo;s tyranny, and all
      that he had made them suffer for their obstinate fidelity to the <i>old
      branch</i>, had heightened and fortified their attachment. It was now
      their turn to glory in that honest obstinacy, and with the strong English
      sense of justice, they triumphed in having the rightful owners restored to
      their estate, and to the seat of their ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Percy family crossed the well-known bridge at the end of the
      village, those bells, which had sounded so mournfully, which had been
      muffled when they quitted their home, now rang out a merry triumphant peal&mdash;and
      it was rung by the hands of the very same persons who had formerly given
      that proof of attachment to him in his adversity.&mdash;Emotion as strong
      now seized Mr. Percy&rsquo;s heart. At the same spot he jumped out of the
      carriage, and by the same path along which he had hastened to stop the
      bell-ringers, lest they should ruin themselves with Sir Robert, he now
      hastened to see and thank these honest, courageous people. In passing
      through the village, which had been freshly swept and garnished the
      people, whom, he remembered to have seen in tears following the carriage
      at their departure, were now crowding to their doors with faces bright
      with smiles. Hats that had never stirred, and backs that had never bent
      for the <i>usurper</i>, were now eager with low bows to mark their proud
      respect to the true man. There were no noisy acclamations, for all were
      touched. The voices of the young children, however, were heard, who, as
      their mothers held them up in their arms, to see the landlord, of whom
      they had heard so much, offered their little nosegays as the open carriage
      passed, and repeated blessings on those, on whom from their cradles, they
      had heard blessings bestowed by their parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old steward stood ready at the park-gate to open it for his master.
      His master and the ladies put their hands out of the carriage to shake
      hands with him, but he could not stand it. He just touched his master&rsquo;s
      hand. Tears streamed down his face, and turning away without being able to
      say one word, he hid himself in the porter&rsquo;s lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they drove up to the house, they saw standing on the steps waiting&mdash;and
      long had he been waiting there, for the first sound of the carriage&mdash;Johnson,
      the butler, who had followed the family to the Hills, and had served them
      in their fallen fortunes&mdash;Johnson was now himself. Before the
      hall-door, wide open to receive them, he stood, with the livery-servants
      in due order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Harte, the good old housekeeper, had been sent down to prepare for
      the reception of the family, and a world of trouble she had had; but all
      was now right and proper, and she was as active and alert as the youngest
      of her maidens could have been, in conducting the ladies to their
      apartments, in showing all the old places, and doing what she called the
      honours of the <i>re-installation</i>. She could have wished to have
      vented a little of her indignation, and to have told how some things had
      been left; but her better taste and judgment, and her sense of what would
      be pleasing to her master and mistress, repressed all recrimination. By
      the help of frequent recurrence to her snuff-box, in difficulties great,
      together with much rubbing of her hands, and some bridling of her head,
      she got through it, without naming those, who should not be thought of, as
      she observed, on this joyful day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The happiness of the Percy family was completed by the return of Godfrey,
      of Caroline, and Count Altenberg. Godfrey arrived just as his family were
      settled at Percy-hall. After his long absence from his home and country,
      he doubly enjoyed this scene of domestic prosperity. Beloved as Rosamond
      was by rich and poor in the neighbourhood, and the general favourite of
      her family, her approaching marriage spread new and universal joy. It is
      impossible to give an idea of the congratulations, and of the bustle of
      the various preparations, which were going on at this time at Percy-hall,
      especially in the lower regions. Even Mrs. Harte&rsquo;s all-regulating genius
      was insufficient for the exigencies of the times. Indeed, her head and her
      heart were now at perpetual variance, continually counteracting and
      contradicting each other. One moment delighted with the joy and affection
      of the world below, she would come up to boast of it to her mistress and
      her young ladies; the next moment she would scold all the people for being
      out of their wits, and for not minding or knowing a single thing they were
      doing, or ordered to do, &ldquo;no more than the babes in the wood;&rdquo; then
      proving the next minute and acknowledging that she was &ldquo;<i>really quite as
      bad as themselves</i>. And no wonder, for the thoughts of Miss Rosamond&rsquo;s
      marriage had turned her head entirely upside down&mdash;for she had been
      at Miss Rosamond&rsquo;s christening, held her by proxy, and considered her
      always as her particular own child, and well she might, for a better,
      except, perhaps, Miss Caroline&mdash;I should say <i>the countess</i>&mdash;never
      breathed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The making a <i>desert</i> island for Miss Rosamond&rsquo;s wedding-dinner was
      the object which had taken such forcible possession of Mrs. Harte&rsquo;s
      imagination, that till it was accomplished it was in vain to hope that any
      other could, in her eyes, appear in any kind of proportion. In the midst
      of all the sentimental joy above stairs, and in the midst of all the
      important business of settlements and lawyers, Mrs. Harte was pursuing the
      settled purpose of her soul, constructing with infinite care, as directed
      by her complete English Housekeeper, a <i>desert island for a wedding</i>,
      in a deep china dish, with a mount in the middle, two figures upon the
      mount, with crowns on their heads, a knot of rock-candy at their feet, and
      gravel-walks of <i>shot comfits</i>, judiciously intersecting in every
      direction their dominions.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As soon as it was possible, after his return to Percy-hall, Mr. Percy went
      to pay his respects to Lord Oldborough. He found this great statesman
      happy in retirement, without any affectation of happiness. There were
      proofs in every thing about him that his mind had unbent itself agreeably;
      his powers had expanded upon different objects, building, planting,
      improving the soil and the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had many tastes, which had long lain dormant, or rather which had been
      held in subjugation by one tyrant passion. That passion vanquished, the
      former tastes resumed their activity. The superior strength of his
      character was shown in his never recurring to ambition. Its vigour was
      displayed in the means by which he supplied himself, not only with variety
      of occupation, but with variety of motive. Those, who best know the human
      mind must be aware of the difficulty of supplying motive for one
      accustomed to stimulus of so high a kind, as that to which Lord Oldborough
      had been habituated. For one who had been at the head of the government of
      a great nation, to make for himself objects in the stillness and privacy
      of a country life, required no common talent and energy of soul. The
      difficulty was increased to Lord Oldborough, for to him the vast resource
      of a taste for literature was wanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The biographer of Sir Robert Walpole tells us, that though he had not
      forgotten his classical attainments, he had little taste for literary
      occupations. Sir Robert once expressed his regret on this subject to Mr.
      Fox, in the library at Houghton. &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I took as much
      delight in reading as you do; it would be the means of alleviating many
      tedious hours in my present retirement. But, to my misfortune, I derive no
      pleasure from such pursuits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough felt, but never condescended to complain of that
      deficiency of general literature, which was caused in him, partly by his
      not having had time for the attainment, and partly by his having formed
      too low an estimate of the influence and power of literature in the
      political world. But he now took peculiar delight in recalling the
      classical studies in which he had in his youth excelled; as Mr. Percy
      sympathized with him in this taste, there was another point in which they
      coalesced. Mr. Percy stayed with his old friend some days, for he was
      anxious to give him this proof of attachment, and felt interested in
      seeing his character develope itself in a new direction, displaying fresh
      life and strength, and unexpected resource in circumstances, in which
      statesmen of the most vigorous minds, and of the highest spirit, have been
      seen to &ldquo;droop and drowse,&rdquo; to sink into indolence, sensuality, or the
      horrors of hypochondriacism and superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough, on his first retiring to Clermont-park, had informed Mr.
      Percy that he should wish to see him as soon as he had arranged certain
      papers. He now reminded his lordship of it, and Lord Oldborough put into
      his hands a sketch, which he had been drawing out, of the principal
      transactions in which he had been engaged during his political career,
      with copies of his letters to the first public characters of the day in
      our own and in foreign countries. Even by those who had felt no regard for
      the man, the letters of such a minister would have been read with avidity;
      but Mr. Percy perused them with a stronger interest than any which could
      be created by mere political or philosophical curiosity. He read them with
      a pleasure which a generous mind takes in admiring that which is good and
      great, with the delight which a true friend feels in seeing proofs that
      justify all the esteem he had previously felt. He saw in these original
      documents, in this history of Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s political life, the most
      perfect consistency and integrity, the most disinterested and enlightened
      patriotism. When Mr. Percy returned the manuscript to his lordship, he
      spoke of the satisfaction he must experience in looking back upon this
      record of a life spent in the service of his country, and observed that he
      was not surprised that, with such a solid source of self-approbation, such
      indefeasible claims to the gratitude of his countrymen, and such
      well-earned fame, he should be, as he appeared, happy in retirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am happy, and, I believe, principally from the cause you have
      mentioned,&rdquo; said Lord Oldborough, who had a mind too great for the
      affectation of humility. &ldquo;So far I am happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; added he, after a considerable pause, &ldquo;I have, I feel, a greater
      capability of happiness, for which I have been prevented from making any
      provision, partly by the course of life of which I made choice, and partly
      by circumstances over which I had no control.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused again; and, turning the conversation, spoke of his sister, an
      elderly lady, who had come to pass some time with him. They had lived
      separate almost all their lives; she in Scotland with her husband, a
      Scottish nobleman, who having died about the time when Lord Oldborough had
      resigned his ministerial situation, she had accepted his lordship&rsquo;s
      invitation to visit him in his retirement. The early attachment he had had
      for this sister seemed to revive in his mind when they met; and, as if
      glad to have some object for his affections, they were poured out upon
      her. Mr. Percy observed a tenderness in his manner and voice when he spoke
      to her, a thousand little attentions, which no one would have expected
      from the apparently stern Lord Oldborough, a man who had been engrossed
      all his life by politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the last day which Mr. Percy meant to spend at
      Clermont-park, his lordship, as they were sitting together in his study,
      expressed more than common regret at the necessity for his friend&rsquo;s
      departure, but said, &ldquo;I have no right to detain you from your family.&rdquo;
       Then, after a pause, he added, &ldquo;Mr. Percy, you first gave me the idea that
      a private life is the happiest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, in most cases I believe it is; but I never meant to assert that
      a public life spent in noble exertion, and with the consciousness of
      superior talent and utility, is not more desirable than the life of any
      obscure individual can possibly be, even though he possess the pleasure of
      domestic ease and tranquillity. There are men of eminent abilities,
      capable of extraordinary exertions, inspired by exalted patriotism. I
      believe, notwithstanding the corruption of so many has weakened all faith
      in public virtue, I believe in the existence of such men, men who devote
      themselves to the service of their country: when the time for their
      relinquishing the toils of public life arrives, honour and
      self-approbation follow them in retirement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, I am happy,&rdquo; repeated Lord Oldborough; &ldquo;but to go on with
      what I began to say to you yesterday&mdash;I feel that some addition might
      be made to my happiness. The sense of having, to the best of my ability,
      done my duty, is satisfactory. I do not require applause&mdash;I disdain
      adulation&mdash;I have sustained my public life without sympathy&mdash;I
      could seldom meet with it&mdash;where I could, I have enjoyed it&mdash;and
      could now enjoy it&mdash;exquisitely&mdash;as you do, Mr. Percy&mdash;surrounded
      by a happy family. Domestic life requires domestic pleasures&mdash;objects
      for the affections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy felt the truth of this, and could answer only by suggesting the
      idea of Mr. Temple, who was firmly and warmly attached to Lord Oldborough,
      and for whom his lordship had a strong regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Temple, and my daughter Rosamond, whom your lordship honoured with so
      kind an invitation, propose, I know, paying their respects to you next
      week. Though I am her father, I may venture to say that Rosamond&rsquo;s
      sprightliness is so mixed with solid information and good sense, that her
      society will become agreeable to your lordship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall rejoice to see Mrs. Temple here. As the daughter of one friend,
      and the wife of another, she has a double claim to my regard. And (to say
      nothing of hereditary genius or dispositions&mdash;in which you do not
      believe, and I do), there can be no doubt that the society of a lady,
      educated as your daughter has been, must suit my taste. The danger is,
      that her society should become necessary to me. For Mr. Temple I already
      feel a degree of affection, which I must repress, rather than indulge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Repress!&mdash;Why so, my lord? You esteem him&mdash;you believe in the
      sincerity of his attachment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why with stoicism&mdash;pardon me, my dear lord&mdash;why repress
      affection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lest I should become dependent for my daily happiness on one, whose
      happiness is independent of mine&mdash;in some degree incompatible with
      mine. Even if his society were given to me, his heart must be at his home,
      and with his family. You see I am no proud stoic, but a man who dares to
      look at life&mdash;the decline of life, such as it is&mdash;as it must be.
      Different, Mr. Percy, in your situation&mdash;and in mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was here interrupted by the arrival of a carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough looked out of the window as it passed&mdash;then smiled,
      and observed how altered the times were, since Clermont-park used to be
      crowded with visitors and carriages&mdash;now the arrival of one is an
      event.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant announced a foreign name, a Neapolitan abbé, who had come over
      in the train of a new ambassador: he had just arrived in England, and had
      letters from the Cardinal . . ., his uncle, which he was desired to
      deliver into Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s own hand. The abbé was, it appeared,
      personally a stranger to him, but there had been some ministerial
      intercourse between his lordship and the cardinal. Lord Oldborough
      received these political letters with an air of composure and indifference
      which proved that he ceased to have an interest in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He supposed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the abbé had been apprized that he was no
      longer one of his majesty&rsquo;s ministers&mdash;that he had resigned his
      official situation&mdash;had retired&mdash;and that he took no part
      whatever in public affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The abbé replied that he had been apprized that Lord Oldborough had
      retired from the public office; but his uncle, he added, with a
      significant smile, was aware that Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s influence was as great
      still as it had ever been, and greater than that of any ostensible
      minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Lord Oldborough disclaimed&mdash;coolly observing that his influence,
      whatever it might be, could not be known even to himself, as it was never
      exerted; and that, as he had determined nevermore to interfere in public
      business, he could not be of the least political service to the cardinal.
      The Duke of Greenwich was now the person to whom on such subjects all
      applications should be addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abbé, however, repeated, that his instructions from the cardinal were
      positive and peremptory, to deliver these letters into no hands but those
      of Lord Oldborough&mdash;that in consequence of this strict injunction he
      had come purposely to present them. He was instructed to request his
      lordship would not put the letters into the hands of any secretary, but
      would have the goodness to examine them himself, and give his counsel how
      to proceed, and to whom they should, in case of his lordship&rsquo;s declining
      to interfere, be addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Percy!&rdquo; said Lord Oldborough, recalling Mr. Percy, who had risen to
      quit the room, &ldquo;you will not leave me&mdash;Whatever you may wish to say,
      M. l&rsquo;abbé, may be said before this gentleman&mdash;my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lordship then opened the packet, examined the letters&mdash;read and
      re-directed some to the Duke of Greenwich, others to the king: the abbé,
      all the time, descanting vehemently on Neapolitan politics&mdash;regretting
      Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s resignation&mdash;adverting still to his lordship&rsquo;s
      powerful influence&mdash;and pressing some point in negotiation, for which
      his uncle, the cardinal, was most anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the letters, there was one which Lord Oldborough did not open: he
      laid it on the table with the direction downwards, leaned his elbow upon
      it, and sat as if calmly listening to the abbé; but Mr. Percy, knowing his
      countenance, saw signs of extraordinary emotion, with difficulty
      repressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the gesticulating abbé finished, and waited his lordship&rsquo;s
      instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were given in few words. The letters re-directed to the king and the
      Duke of Greenwich were returned to him. He thanked his lordship with many
      Italian superlatives&mdash;declined his lordship&rsquo;s invitation to stay till
      the next day at Clermont-park&mdash;said he was pressed in point of time&mdash;that
      it was indispensably necessary for him to be in London, to deliver these
      papers, as soon as possible. His eye glanced on the unopened letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Private, sir,&rdquo; said Lord Oldborough, in a stern voice, without moving his
      elbow from the paper: &ldquo;whatever answer it may require, I shall have the
      honour to transmit to you&mdash;for the cardinal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The abbé bowed low, left his address, and took leave. Lord Oldborough,
      after attending him to the door, and seeing him depart, returned, took out
      his watch, and said to Mr. Percy &ldquo;Come to me, in my cabinet, in five
      minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing his sister on the walk approaching his house, he added, &ldquo;Let none
      follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the five minutes were over, Mr. Percy went to Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s
      cabinet&mdash;knocked&mdash;no answer&mdash;knocked again&mdash;louder&mdash;all
      was silent&mdash;he entered&mdash;and saw Lord Oldborough seated, but in
      the attitude of one just going to rise; he looked more like a statue than
      a living person: there was a stiffness in his muscles, and over his face
      and hands a deathlike colour. His eyes were fixed, and directed towards
      the door&mdash;but they never moved when Mr. Percy entered, nor did Lord
      Oldborough stir at his approach. From one hand, which hung over the arm of
      his chair, his spectacles had dropped; his other hand grasped an open
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear lord!&rdquo; cried Mr. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He neither heard nor answered. Mr. Percy opened the window and let down
      the blind. Then attempting to raise the hand which hung down, he perceived
      it was fixed in all the rigidity of catalepsy. In hopes of recalling his
      senses or his power of motion, Mr. Percy determined to try to draw the
      letter from his grasp; the moment the letter was touched, Lord Oldborough
      started&mdash;his eyes darting fiercely upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who dares? Who are you, sir?&rdquo; cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend, Percy&mdash;my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough pointed to a chair&mdash;Mr. Percy sat down. His lordship
      recovered gradually from the species of trance into which he had fallen.
      The cataleptic rigidity of his figure relaxed&mdash;the colour of life
      returned&mdash;the body regained its functions&mdash;the soul resumed at
      once her powers. Without seeming sensible of any interruption or
      intermission of feeling or thought, Lord Oldborough went on speaking to
      Mr. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letter which I now hold in my hand is from that Italian lady of
      transcendent beauty, in whose company you once saw me when we first met at
      Naples. She was of high rank&mdash;high endowments. I loved her; how well&mdash;I
      need not&mdash;cannot say. We married secretly. I was induced&mdash;no
      matter how&mdash;to suspect her fidelity&mdash;pass over these
      circumstances&mdash;I cannot speak or think of them. We parted&mdash;I
      never saw her more. She retired to a convent, and died shortly after: nor
      did I, till I received this letter, written on her death-bed, know that
      she had given me a son. The proofs that I wronged her are irresistible.
      Would that they had been given to me when I could have repaired my
      injustice!&mdash;But her pride prevented their being sent till the hour of
      her death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the first reading of her letter, Lord Oldborough had been so struck by
      the idea of the injustice he had done the mother, that he seemed scarcely
      to advert to the idea of his having a son. Absorbed in the past, he was at
      first insensible both to the present and the future. Early associations,
      long dormant, were suddenly wakened; he was carried back with irresistible
      force to the days of his youth, and something of likeness in air and voice
      to the Lord Oldborough he had formerly known appeared to Mr. Percy. As the
      tumult of passionate recollections subsided, as this enthusiastic
      reminiscence faded, and the memory of the past gave way to the sense of
      the present, Lord Oldborough resumed his habitual look and manner. His
      thoughts turned upon his son, that unknown being who belonged to him, who
      had claims upon him, who might form a great addition to the happiness or
      misery of his life. He took up the letter again, looked for the passage
      that related to his son, and read it anxiously to himself, then to Mr.
      Percy&mdash;observing, &ldquo;that the directions were so vague, that it would
      be difficult to act upon them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy was sent when three years old to England or Ireland, under the
      care of an Irish priest, who delivered him to a merchant, recommended by
      the Hamburg banker, &amp;c.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have difficulty in tracing this&mdash;great danger of being
      mistaken or deceived,&rdquo; said Lord Oldborough, pausing with a look of
      anxiety. &ldquo;Would to God that I had means of knowing with certainty <i>where</i>,
      and above all, <i>what</i>, he is, or that I had never heard of his
      existence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, are there any more particulars?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Percy, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough continued to read, &ldquo;Four hundred pounds of your English
      money have been remitted to him annually, by means of these Hamburg
      bankers. To them we must apply in the first instance,&rdquo; said Lord
      Oldborough, &ldquo;and I will write this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, my lord, I can save you the trouble,&rdquo; said Mr. Percy: &ldquo;I know
      the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough put down his pen, and looked at Mr. Percy with
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lord, however extraordinary it may appear, I repeat it&mdash;I
      believe I know your son; and if he be the man I imagine him to be, I
      congratulate you&mdash;you have reason to rejoice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The facts, my dear sir,&rdquo; cried Lord Oldborough: &ldquo;do not raise my hopes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy repeated all that he had heard from Godfrey of Mr. Henry&mdash;related
      every circumstance from the first commencement of them&mdash;the
      impertinence and insult to which the mystery that hung over his birth had
      subjected him in the regiment&mdash;the quarrels in the regiment&mdash;the
      goodness of Major Gascoigne&mdash;the gratitude of Mr. Henry&mdash;the
      attachment between him and Godfrey&mdash;his selling out of the regiment
      after Godfrey&rsquo;s ineffectual journey to London&mdash;his wishing to go into
      a mercantile house&mdash;the letter which Godfrey then wrote, begging his
      father to recommend Mr. Henry to Mr. Gresham, disclosing to Mr. Percy,
      with Mr. Henry&rsquo;s permission, all that he knew of his birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have that letter at home,&rdquo; said Mr. Percy: &ldquo;your lordship shall see it.
      I perfectly recollect the circumstances of Mr. Henry&rsquo;s having been brought
      up in Ireland by a Dublin merchant, and having received constantly a
      remittance in quarterly payments of four hundred pounds a year, from a
      banker in Cork.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he inquire why, or from whom?&rdquo; said Lord Oldborough; &ldquo;and does he
      know his mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not: the answer to his first inquiries prevented all further
      questions. He was told by the bankers that they had directions to stop
      payment of the remittance if any questions were asked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough listened with profound attention as Mr. Percy went on with
      the history of Mr. Henry, relating all the circumstances of his honourable
      conduct with respect to Miss Panton&mdash;his disinterestedness, decision,
      and energy of affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s emotion increased&mdash;he seemed to recognize some
      traits of his own character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>hope</i> this youth is my son,&rdquo; said his lordship, in a low
      suppressed voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He deserves to be yours, my lord,&rdquo; said Mr. Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To have a son might be the greatest of evils&mdash;to have <i>such</i> a
      son must be the greatest of blessings,&rdquo; said his lordship. He was lost in
      thought for a moment, then exclaimed, &ldquo;I must see the letter&mdash;I must
      see the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, he is at my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough started from his seat&mdash;&ldquo;Let me see him instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, my lord,&rdquo; said Mr. Percy, in a calm tone, for it was necessary
      to calm his impetuosity&mdash;&ldquo;to-morrow. Mr. Henry could not be brought
      here to-night without alarming him, or without betraying to him the cause
      of our anxiety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, let it be&mdash;you are right, my dear friend. Let me see him
      without his suspecting that I am any thing to him, or he to me&mdash;you
      will let me have the letter to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy sympathized with his impatience, and gratified it with all the
      celerity of a friend: the letter was sent that night to Lord Oldborough.
      In questioning his sons more particularly concerning Mr. Henry, Mr. Percy
      learnt from Erasmus a fresh and strong corroborating circumstance. Dr.
      Percy had been lately attending Mr. Gresham&rsquo;s porter, O&rsquo;Brien, the
      Irishman; who had been so ill, that, imagining himself dying, he had sent
      for a priest. Mr. Henry was standing by the poor fellow&rsquo;s bedside when the
      priest arrived, who was so much struck by the sight of him, that for some
      time his attention could scarcely be fixed on the sick man. The priest,
      after he had performed his official duties, returned to Mr. Henry, begged
      pardon for having looked at him with so much earnestness, but said that
      Mr. Henry strongly reminded him of the features of an Italian lady who had
      committed a child to his care many years ago. This led to farther
      explanation, and upon comparing dates and circumstances, Mr. Henry was
      convinced that this was the very priest who had carried him over to
      Ireland&mdash;the priest recognized him to be the child of whom he had
      taken charge; but farther, all was darkness. The priest knew nothing more&mdash;not
      even the name of the lady from whom he had received the child. He knew
      only that he had been handsomely rewarded by the Dublin merchant, to whom
      he had delivered the boy&mdash;and he had heard that this merchant had
      since become bankrupt, and had fled to America. This promise of a
      discovery, and sudden stop to his hopes, had only mortified poor Mr.
      Henry, and had irritated that curiosity which he had endeavoured to lull
      to repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy was careful, both for Mr. Henry&rsquo;s sake and for Lord
      Oldborough&rsquo;s, not to excite hopes which might not ultimately be
      accomplished. He took precautions to prevent him from suspecting any thing
      extraordinary in the intended introduction to Lord Oldborough.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been some dispute between the present minister and some London
      merchant, about the terms of a loan which had been made by Lord Oldborough&mdash;Mr.
      Gresham&rsquo;s house had some concern in this transaction; and it was now
      settled between Mr. Percy and Lord Oldborough, that his lordship should
      write to desire to see Mr. Henry, who, as Mr. Gresham&rsquo;s partner, could
      give every necessary information. Mr. Henry accordingly was summoned to
      Clermont-park, and accompanied Mr. Percy, with his mind intent upon this
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Henry, in common with all who were capable of estimating a great
      public character, had conceived high admiration for Lord Oldborough; he
      had seen him only in public, and at a distance&mdash;and it was not
      without awe that he now thought of being introduced to him, and of hearing
      and speaking to him in private.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough, meanwhile, who had been satisfied by the perusal of the
      letter, and by Mr. Percy&rsquo;s information, waited for his arrival with
      extreme impatience. He was walking up and down his room, and looking
      frequently at his watch, which he believed more than once to have stopped.
      At length the door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Percy, and Mr. Henry, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Oldborough&rsquo;s eye darted upon Henry. Struck instantly with the
      resemblance to the mother, Lord Oldborough rushed forward, and clasping
      him in his arms, exclaimed, &ldquo;My son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tenderness, excessive tenderness, was in his look, voice, soul, as if he
      wished to repair in a moment the injustice of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lord Oldborough, &ldquo;<i>now</i> I am happy&mdash;<i>now</i>, I
      also, Mr. Percy, may be proud of a son&mdash;I too shall know the
      pleasures of domestic life. Now I am happy!&rdquo; repeated he,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;And, pleased, resigned
  To tender passions all his mighty mind.&rdquo;

    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> &lsquo;Tis not pritty, I grant; but her heart&rsquo;s good, if her
      temper would give it fair play. But will you promise me, Phil, whatever
      she says&mdash;you won&rsquo;t let her provoke you this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> How in the name of wonder will I hinder her to give me
      provocation? and when the spirit of the McBrides is up&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> But don&rsquo;t lift a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> Against a woman?&mdash;no fear&mdash;not a finger against a
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> But I say not against any Rooney, man or woman. Oh, Phil!
      dear, don&rsquo;t let there be any fighting betwixt the McBride and Rooney
      factions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> And how could I hinder if I would? The boys will be having a
      row, especially when they get the spirits&mdash;and all the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> To be drinking! Oh! Phil, the mischief that drinking does!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> Mischief! Quite and clane the contrary&mdash;when the
      shillelah&rsquo;s up, the pike&rsquo;s down. &lsquo;Tis when there&rsquo;d be no fights at fairs,
      and all sober, then there&rsquo;s rason to dread mischief. No man, Honor, dare
      be letting the whiskey into his head, was there any mischief in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Well, Phil, you&rsquo;ve made it out now cliverly. So there&rsquo;s most
      danger of mischief when men&rsquo;s sober&mdash;is that it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> Irishmen?&mdash;ay; for sobriety is not the nat&rsquo;ral state of
      the <i>craturs</i>; and what&rsquo;s not nat&rsquo;ral is hypocritical, and a
      hypocrite is, and was, and ever will be my contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> And mine too. But&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> But here&rsquo;s my hand for you, Honor. They call me a beau and a
      buck, a slasher and dasher, and flourishing Phil. All that I am, may be;
      but there&rsquo;s one thing I am not, and will never be&mdash;and that&rsquo;s a bad
      brother to you. So you have my honour, and here&rsquo;s my oath to the back of
      it. By all the pride of man and all the consate of woman&mdash;where will
      you find a bigger oath?&mdash;happen what will, this day, I&rsquo;ll not lift my
      hand against Randal Rooney!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Oh, thanks! warm from the heart. But here&rsquo;s my father&mdash;and
      where&rsquo;s breakfast?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> Oh! I must be at him for a horse: you, Honor, mind and back
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter Old McBRIDE.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Late I am this fair day all along with my beard, that was
      thicker than a hedgehog&rsquo;s. Breakfast, where?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Here, father dear&mdash;all ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> There&rsquo;s a jewel! always supple o&rsquo; foot. Phil, call to them
      to bring out the horse bastes, while I swallow my breakfast&mdash;and a
      good one, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> Your horse is all ready standing, sir. But that&rsquo;s what I
      wanted to ax you, father&mdash;will you be kind enough, sir, to shell out
      for me the price of a <i>daacent</i> horse, fit to mount a man like me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> What ails the baste you have under you always?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> Fit only for the hounds:&mdash;not to follow, but to feed
      &lsquo;em.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Hounds! I don&rsquo;t want you, Phil, to be following the hounds
      at-all-at-all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> But let alone the hounds. If you sell your bullocks well in
      the fair to-day, father dear, I think you&rsquo;ll be so kind to spare Phil the
      price of a horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Stand out o&rsquo; my way, Honor, with that wheedling voice o&rsquo; 
      your own&mdash;I won&rsquo;t. Mind your own affairs&mdash;you&rsquo;re leaguing again
      me, and I&rsquo;ll engage Randal Rooney&rsquo;s at the bottom of all&mdash;and the
      cement that sticks you and Phil so close together. But mind, Madam Honor,
      if you give him the meeting at the fair the day&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Dear father, I&rsquo;m not going&mdash;I give up the fair o&rsquo; 
      purpose, for fear I&rsquo;d see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> (<i>kissing her</i>) Why then you&rsquo;re a piece of an angel!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> And you&rsquo;ll give my brother the horse?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> I won&rsquo;t! when I&rsquo;ve said I won&rsquo;t&mdash;I wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>Buttons his coat, and exit.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> Now there&rsquo;s a sample of a father for ye!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> (<i>returning</i>) And, Mistress Honor, may be you&rsquo;d be
      staying at home to&mdash;Where&rsquo;s Randal Rooney to be, pray, while I&rsquo;d be
      from home?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Oh! father, would you suspect&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> (<i>catching her in his arms, and kissing her again and
      again</i>) Then you&rsquo;re a true angel, every inch of you. But not a word
      more in favour of the horse&mdash;sure the money for the bullocks shall go
      to your portion, every farthing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> There&rsquo;s the thing! (<i>Holding her father</i>) I don&rsquo;t wish
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> (<i>stopping her mouth</i>) Say no more, Honor&mdash;I&rsquo;m best
      pleased so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> (<i>aside</i>) I&rsquo;ll give him the horse, but he sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
      know it. (<i>Aloud</i>) I won&rsquo;t. When I say I won&rsquo;t, did I ever?
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>Exit Old McBRIDE.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> Never since the world <i>stud</i>&mdash;to do you justice,
      you are as obstinate as a mule. Not all the bullocks he&rsquo;s carrying to the
      fair the day, nor all the bullocks in Ballynavogue joined to &lsquo;em, in one
      team, would draw that father o&rsquo; mine one inch out of his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> (<i>aside, with a deep sigh</i>) Oh, then what will I do
      about Randal ever!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> As close a fisted father as ever had the grip of a guinea! If
      the guineas was all for you&mdash;wilcome, Honor! But that&rsquo;s not it. Pity
      of a lad o&rsquo; spirit like me to be cramped by such a hunx of a father.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Oh! don&rsquo;t be calling him names, Phil: stiff he is, more than
      close&mdash;and any way, Phil dear, he&rsquo;s the father still&mdash;and ould,
      consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> He is,&mdash;and I&rsquo;m fond enough of him, too, would he only
      give me the price of a horse. But no matter&mdash;spite of him I&rsquo;ll have
      my swing the day, and it&rsquo;s I that will tear away with a good horse under
      me and a good whip over him in a capital style, up and down the street of
      Ballynavogue, for you, Miss Car&rsquo;line Flaherty! I know who I&rsquo;ll go to, this
      minute&mdash;a man I&rsquo;ll engage will lend me the loan of his bay gelding;
      and that&rsquo;s Counshillor Gerald O&rsquo;Blaney. {<i>Going, HONOR stops him.</i>
    </p>

      <i>Honor.</i> Gerald O&rsquo;Blaney! Oh, brother!&mdash;Mercy!&mdash;Don&rsquo;t! any
      thing rather than that&mdash;

      <i>Phil.</i> (<i>impatiently</i>) Why, then, Honor?

    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> (<i>aside</i>) If I&rsquo;d tell him, there&rsquo;d be mischief. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
      Only&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t wish you under a compliment to one I&rsquo;ve no opinion
      of.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> Phoo! you&rsquo;ve taken a prejudice. What is there again
      Counshillor O&rsquo;Blaney?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> <i>Counshillor!</i> First place, why do you call him <i>counshillor</i>?
      he never was a raal counshillor sure&mdash;nor jantleman at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> Oh! counshillor by courtesy&mdash;he was an attorney once&mdash;just
      as we <i>doctor</i> the apotecary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> But, Phil, was not there something of this man&rsquo;s being
      dismissed the courts for too sharp practice?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> But that was long ago, if it ever was. There&rsquo;s sacrets in all
      families to be forgotten&mdash;bad to be raking the past. I never knew you
      so sharp on a neighbour, Honor, before:&mdash;what ails ye?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> (<i>sighing</i>) I can&rsquo;t tell ye. {<i>Still holding him.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> Let me go, then!&mdash;Nonsense!&mdash;the boys of

      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Of all the employments in life, this eternal balancing of
      accounts, see-saw, is the most sickening of all things, except it would be
      the taking the inventory of your stock, when you&rsquo;re reduced to <i>invent</i>
      the stock itself;&mdash;then that&rsquo;s the most lowering to a man of all
      things! But there&rsquo;s one comfort in this distillery business&mdash;come

      objection:&mdash;there&rsquo;s that Randal Rooney is a great <i>bachelor</i> of
      hers, and I doubt she&rsquo;d be apt to prefar him before me, even when I&rsquo;d
      purpose marriage. But the families of the Rooneys and McBrides is at
      vareance&mdash;then I must keep &lsquo;em so. I&rsquo;ll keep Catty Rooney&rsquo;s spirit
      up, niver to consent to that match. Oh! if them Rooneys and McBrides were
      by any chance to make it up, I&rsquo;d be undone: but against that catastrophe
      I&rsquo;ve a preventative. Pat Coxe! Pat Coxe! where are you, my young man?

      minutes, till you&rsquo;re at Catty Rooney&rsquo;s, and let me see how cliverly you&rsquo;ll
      execute that confidential embassy I trusted you with. Touch Catty up about
      her ould ancient family, and all the Kings of Ireland she comes from. <i>Blarney</i>
      her cliverly, and work her to a foam against the McBrides.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> Never fear, your honour. I&rsquo;ll tell her the story we agreed on,
      of Honor McBride meeting of Randal Rooney behind the chapel.

    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> That will do&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget the ring; for I mane to put
      another on the girl&rsquo;s finger, if she&rsquo;s agreeable, and knows her own
      interest. But that last&rsquo;s a private article. Not a word of that to Catty,
      you understand.

      <i>Pat.</i> Oh! I understand&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll engage I&rsquo;ll compass Catty,
      tho&rsquo; she&rsquo;s a cunning shaver.

    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Cunning?&mdash;No; she&rsquo;s only hot tempered, and asy managed.

    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> Whatever she is, I&rsquo;ll do my best to plase you. And I expict
      your honour, counsellor, won&rsquo;t forget the promise you made me, to ask Mr.
      Carver for that little place&mdash;that situation that would just shute
      me.

    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Never fear, never fear. Time enough to think of shuting you,
      when you&rsquo;ve done my business. {<i>Exit PAT.</i> That will work like harm,
      and ould Matthew, the father, I&rsquo;ll speak to, myself, genteelly. He will be
      proud, I warrant, to match his daughter with a gentleman like me. But what
      if he should smell a rat, and want to be looking into my affairs? Oh! I
      must get it sartified properly to him before all things, that I&rsquo;m as safe
      as the bank; and I know who shall do that for me&mdash;my worthy friend,
      that most consequential magistrate, Mr. Carver of Bob&rsquo;s Fort, who loves to
      be advising and managing of all men, women, and children, for their good.
      &lsquo;Tis he shall advise ould Matthew for <i>my</i> good. Now Carver thinks he
      lades the whole county, and ten mile round&mdash;but who is it lades him,
      I want to know? Why, Gerald O&rsquo;Blaney.&mdash;And how? Why, by a spoonful of
      the universal panacea, <i>flattery</i>&mdash;in the vulgar tongue, <i>flummery</i>.
      (<i>A knock at the door heard.</i>) Who&rsquo;s rapping at the street?&mdash;Carver
      of Bob&rsquo;s Fort himself, in all his glory this fair-day. See then how he
      struts and swells. Did ever man, but a pacock, look so fond of himself
      with less rason? But I must be caught deep in accounts, and a balance of
      thousands to credit. (<i>Sits down to his desk, to account books.</i>)
      Seven thousand, three hundred, and two pence. (<i>Starting and rising.</i>)
      Do I see Mr. Carver of Bob&rsquo;s Fort?&mdash;Oh! the honour&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Don&rsquo;t stir, pray&mdash;I beg&mdash;I request&mdash;I
      insist. I am by no means ceremonious, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> (<i>bustling and setting two chairs</i>) No, but I&rsquo;d wish to
      show respect proper to him I consider the first man in the county.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> (<i>aside</i>) Man! gentleman, he might have said.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>Mr. CARVER sits down and rests himself consequentially.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Now, Mr. Carver of Bob&rsquo;s Fort, you&rsquo;ve been over fartiguing
      yourself&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> For the public good. I can&rsquo;t help it, really.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Oh! but, upon my word and honour, it&rsquo;s too much: there&rsquo;s
      rason in all things. A man of Mr. Carver&rsquo;s fortin to be slaving! If you
      were a man in business, like me, it would be another thing. I must slave
      at the desk to keep all round. See, Mr. Carver, see!&mdash;ever since the
      day you advised me to be as particular as yourself in keeping accounts to
      a farthing, I do, to a fraction, even like state accounts, see!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> And I trust you find your advantage in it, sir. Pray, how
      does the distillery business go on?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Swimmingly! ever since that time, Mr. Carver, your interest
      at the castle helped me at the dead lift, and got that fine took off. &lsquo;Tis
      to your purtiction, encouragement, and advice entirely, I owe my present
      unexampled prosperity, which you prophesied; and Mr. Carver&rsquo;s prophecies
      seldom, I may say never, fail to be accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> I own there is some truth in your observation. I confess
      I have seldom been mistaken or deceived in my judgment of man, woman, or
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Who can say so much?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> For what reason, I don&rsquo;t pretend to say; but the fact
      ostensibly is, that the few persons I direct with my advice are
      unquestionably apt to prosper in this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Mighty apt! for which rason I would wish to trouble you for
      your unprecedently good advice on another pint, if it, would not be too
      great a liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> No liberty at all, my good Gerald&mdash;I am always ready
      to advise&mdash;only to-day&mdash;certainly, the fair day of Ballynavogue,
      there are so many calls upon me, both in a public and private capacity, so
      much business of vital importance!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> (<i>aside</i>) Vital importance!&mdash;that is his word on
      all occasions. (<i>Aloud</i>) May be then, (oh! where was my head?) may be
      you would not have breakfasted all this time? and we&rsquo;ve the kittle down
      always in this house, (<i>rising</i>) Pat!&mdash;Jack!&mdash;Mick!&mdash;Jenny!
      put the kittle down.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Sit down, sit still, my worthy fellow. Breakfasted at
      Bob&rsquo;s Fort, as I always do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> But a bit of cake&mdash;a glass of wine, to refrish and
      replinish nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Too early&mdash;spoil my dinner. But what was I going to
      say?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> (<i>aside</i>) Burn me, if I know; and I pray all the saints
      you may never recollect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> I recollect. How many times do you think I was stopped on
      horseback coming up the street of Ballynavogue?&mdash;Five times by
      weights and measures imperiously calling for reformation, sir. Thirteen
      times, upon my veracity, by booths, apple-stalls, nuisances, vagabonds,
      and drunken women. Pigs without end, sir&mdash;wanting ringing, and all
      squealing in my ears, while I was settling sixteen disputes about tolls
      and customs. Add to this, my regular battle every fair-day with the crane,
      which ought to be any where but where it is; and my perputual discoveries
      of fraudulent kegs, and stones in the butter! Now, sir, I only ask, can
      you wonder that I wipe my forehead? (<i>wiping his forehead</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> In troth, Mr. Carver, I cannot! But these are the pains and
      penalties of being such a man of consequence as you evidently are;&mdash;and
      I that am now going to add to your troubles too by consulting you about my
      little pint!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> A point of law, I dare to say; for people somehow or
      other have got such a prodigious opinion of my law. (<i>Takes snuff.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> (<i>aside</i>) No coming to the pint till he has finished
      his own panygeric.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> And I own I cannot absolutely turn my back on people. Yet
      as to <i>poor</i> people, I always settle them by telling them, it is my
      principle that law is too expensive for the poor: I tell them, the poor
      have nothing to do with the laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Except the penal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> True, the civil is for us, men of property; and no man
      should think of going to law, without he&rsquo;s qualified. There should be
      licenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> No doubt. Pinalties there are in plinty; still those who can
      afford should indulge. In Ireland it would as ill become a gentleman to be
      any way shy of a law-shute, as of a duel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Yet law is expensive, sir, even to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> But &lsquo;tis the best economy in the end; for when once you have
      cast or non-shuted your man in the courts, &lsquo;tis as good as winged him in
      the field. And suppose you don&rsquo;t get sixpence costs, and lose your cool
      hundred by it, still it&rsquo;s a great advantage; for you are let alone to
      enjoy your own in pace and quiet ever after, which you could not do in
      this county without it. But the love of the law has carried me away from
      my business: the pint I wanted to consult you about is not a pint of law;
      &lsquo;tis another matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> (<i>looking at his watch</i>) I must be at Bob&rsquo;s Fort, to
      seal my despatches for the castle. And there&rsquo;s another thing I say of
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> (<i>aside</i>) Remorseless agotist!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> I don&rsquo;t know how the people all have got such an idea of
      my connexions at the castle, and my influence with his Excellency, that I
      am worried with eternal applications: they expect I can make them all
      gaugers or attorney-generals, I believe. How do they know I write to the
      castle?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Oh! the post-office tells asy by the big sales (seals) to
      your despatches&mdash;(<i>aside</i>)&mdash;which, I&rsquo;ll engage, is all the
      castle ever, rades of them, though Carver has his Excellency always in his
      mouth, God help him!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Well, you wanted to consult me, Gerald?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> And you&rsquo;ll give me your advice, which will be conclusive,
      law, and every thing to me. You know the McBrides&mdash;would they be
      safe?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Very safe, substantial people.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Then here&rsquo;s the thing, Mr. Carver: as you recommend them,
      and as they are friends of yours&mdash;I will confess to you that, though
      it might not in pint of interest be a very prudent match, I am thinking
      that Honor McBride is such a prudent girl, and Mrs. Carver has taken her
      by the hand, so I&rsquo;d wish to follow Mrs. Carver&rsquo;s example for life, in
      taking Honor by the hand for better for worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> In my humble opinion you cannot do better; and I can tell
      you a secret&mdash;Honor will have no contemptible fortune in that rank of
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Oh, fortune&rsquo;s always contemptible in marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Fortune! sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> (<i>aside</i>) Overshot. (<i>Aloud</i>) In comparison with
      the patronage and protection or countenance she&rsquo;d have from you and your
      family, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> That you may depend upon, my good Gerald, as far as we
      can go; but you know we are nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Oh, I know you&rsquo;re every thing&mdash;every thing on earth&mdash;particularly
      with ould McBride; and you know how to speak so well and iloquent, and I&rsquo;m
      so tongue-tied and bashful on such an occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Well, well, I&rsquo;ll speak for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> A thousand thanks down to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> (<i>patting him on the back as he rises</i>) My <i>poor</i>
      Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Then I am <i>poor</i> Gerald in point of wit, I know; but
      you are too good a friend to be calling me <i>poor</i> to ould McBride&mdash;you
      can say what I can&rsquo;t say.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Certainly, certainly; and you may depend on me. I shall
      speak my decided opinion; and I fancy McBride has sense enough to be ruled
      by me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> I am sure he has&mdash;only there&rsquo;s a Randal Rooney, a wild
      young man, in the case. I&rsquo;d be sorry the girl was thrown I away upon
      Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> She has too much sense: the father will settle that, and
      I&rsquo;ll settle the father. {<i>Mr. CARVER going.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> (<i>following, aside</i>) And who has settled you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Don&rsquo;t stir&mdash;don&rsquo;t stir&mdash;men of business must be
      nailed to a spot&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not ceremonious. {<i>Exit Mr. CARVER.</i>

      SCENE III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. CARVER&rsquo;S Dressing-room.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. CARVER sitting at work.&mdash;BLOOMSBURY standing.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> Certainly, ma&rsquo;am, what I always said was, that for the
      commonalty, there&rsquo;s no getting out of an Irish cabin a girl fit to be
      about a lady such as you, Mrs. Carver, in the shape of a waiting-maid or
      waiting-maid&rsquo;s assistant, on account they smell so of smoke, which is very
      distressing; but this Honor McBride seems a bettermost sort of girl,
      ma&rsquo;am; if you can make up your mind to her <i>vice</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Carv.</i> Vice?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> That is, vicious pronounciations in regard to their Irish
      brogues.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Carv.</i> Is that all?&mdash;I am quite accustomed to <i>the
      accent</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> Then, ma&rsquo;am, I declare now, I&rsquo;ve been forced to stuff my <i>hears</i>
      with cotton wool hever since I comed to Ireland. But this here Honor
      McBride has a mighty pretty <i>vice</i>, if you don&rsquo;t take exceptions to a
      little nationality; nor she if not so smoke-dried: she&rsquo;s really a nice,
      tidy-looking like girl considering. I&rsquo;ve taken tea with the family often,
      and they live quite snug for Hirish. I&rsquo;ll assure you, ma&rsquo;am, quite
      bettermost people for Hibernians, as you always said, ma&rsquo;am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Carv.</i> I have a regard for old Matthew, though he is something
      of a miser, I fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> So, ma&rsquo;am, shall I call the girl up, that we may see and
      talk to her? I think, ma&rsquo;am, you&rsquo;ll find she will do; and I reckon to keep
      her under my own eye and advice from morning till night: for when I seed
      the girl so willing to larn, I quite took a fancy to her, I own&mdash;as
      it were.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Carv.</i> Well, Bloomsbury, let me see this Honor McBride.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> (<i>calling</i>) One of you there! please call up Honor
      McBride.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Carv.</i> She has been waiting a great while, I fear; I don&rsquo;t like
      to keep people waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> (<i>watching for HONOR as she speaks</i>) Dear heart, ma&rsquo;am,
      in this here country, people does love waiting for waiting&rsquo;s sake, that&rsquo;s
      sure&mdash;they got nothing else to do. Here, Honor&mdash;walk in, Honor,&mdash;rub
      your shoes always.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter HONOR, timidly.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Carv.</i> (<i>in an encouraging voice</i>) Come in, my good girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> Oh! child, the door: the peoples never shut a door in,
      Ireland! Did not I warn you?&mdash;says I, &ldquo;Come when you&rsquo;re called&mdash;do
      as you&rsquo;re bid&mdash;shut the door after you, and you&rsquo;ll never be chid.&rdquo;
       Now what did I tell you, child?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> To shut the door after me when I&rsquo;d come into a room.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> <i>When I&rsquo;d come</i>&mdash;now that&rsquo;s not dic&rsquo;snary English.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Carv.</i> Good Bloomsbury, let that pass for the present&mdash;come
      a little nearer to me, my good girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Yes, ma&rsquo;am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> Take care of that china pyramint with your cloak&mdash;walk
      on to Mrs. Carver&mdash;no need to be afraid&mdash;I&rsquo;ll stand your friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Carv.</i> I should have thought, Honor McBride, you were in too
      comfortable a way at home, to think of going into service.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> (<i>sighs</i>) No better father, nor brother, <i>nor</i>
      (than) I have, ma&rsquo;am, I thank your ladyship; but some things come across.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Carv.</i> (<i>aside</i>) Oh! it is a blushing case, I see: I must
      talk to her alone, by-and-by. (<i>Aloud</i>) I don&rsquo;t mean, my good girl,
      to pry into your family affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Oh! ma&rsquo;am, you&rsquo;re too good. (<i>Aside</i>) The kind-hearted
      Lady, how I love her already! (<i>She wipes the tears from her eyes.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> Take care of the bow-pot at your elbow, child; for if you
      break the necks of them moss roses&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> I ax their pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Carv.</i> Better take the flower-pot out of her way, Bloomsbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> (<i>moving the flower-pot</i>) There, now: but, Honor, keep
      your eyes on my lady, never turn your head, and keep your hands always
      afore you, as I show you. Ma&rsquo;am, she&rsquo;ll larn manners in time&mdash;Lon&rsquo;on
      was not built in a day. It i&rsquo;n&rsquo;t to be expected of she!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Carv.</i> It is not to be expected indeed that she should learn
      every thing at once; so one thing at a time, good Bloomsbury, and one
      person at a time. Leave Honor to me for the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> Certainly, ma&rsquo;am; I beg pardon&mdash;I was only saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Carv.</i> Since it is, it seems, necessary, my good girl, that you
      should leave home, I am glad that you are not too proud to go into
      service.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Oh! into <i>your</i> service, ma&rsquo;am,&mdash;I&rsquo;d be too proud
      if you&rsquo;d be kind enough to accept me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Carv.</i> Then as to wages, what do you expect?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Any thing at all you please, ma&rsquo;am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> (<i>pressing down her shoulder</i>) And where&rsquo;s your curtsy?
      We shall bring these Irish knees into training by and by, I hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> I&rsquo;m awk&rsquo;ard and strange, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;I never was from home
      afore.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Carv.</i> Poor girl&mdash;we shall agree very well, I hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Oh yes, any thing at all, ma&rsquo;am; I&rsquo;m not greedy&mdash;nor
      needy, thanks above! but it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d wish to be under your protection if
      it was plasing, and I&rsquo;ll do my very best, madam. (<i>Curtsies.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Carv.</i> Nobody can expect more, and I hope and trust you&rsquo;ll find
      mine an easy place&mdash;Bloomsbury, you will tell her, what will be
      required of her. (<i>Mrs. Carver looks at her watch.</i>) At twelve
      o&rsquo;clock I shall be returned from my walk, and then, Honor, you will come
      into my cabinet here; I want to say a few words to you. {<i>Exeunt omnes.</i>

      distiller&rsquo;s, young man, Pat Coxe: now we&rsquo;ll larn all&mdash;and whether
      O&rsquo;Blaney can lend me the loan of a horse or no. A good morrow to you,
      kindly, Mr. Pat Coxe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter PAT COXE.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> And you the same, Mrs. Rooney, tinfold. Mr. O&rsquo;Blaney has his
      <i>sarvices</i> to you, ma&rsquo;am: no, not his <i>sarvices</i>, but his
      compliments, that was the word&mdash;his kind compliments, that was the
      very word.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> The counshillor&rsquo;s always very kind to me, and genteel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> And was up till past two in the morning, last night, madam, he
      bid me say, looking over them papers you left with him for your shuit,
      ma&rsquo;am, with the McBrides, about the bit of Ballynascraw bog; and if you
      call upon the counshillor in the course of the morning, he&rsquo;ll find, or
      make, a minute, for a consultation, he says. But mane time, to take no
      step to compromise, or make it up, <i>for your life</i>, ma&rsquo;am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> No fear, I&rsquo;ll not give up at law, or any way, to a McBride,
      while I&rsquo;ve a drop of blood in my veins&mdash;and it&rsquo;s good thick Irish
      blood runs in these veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> No doubt, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;from the kings of Ireland, as all the
      world knows, Mrs. Rooney.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> And the McBrides have no blood at-all-at-all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> Not a drop, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;so they can&rsquo;t stand before you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> They <i>ought</i> not, any way!&mdash;What are they?
      Cromwellians at the best. Mac Brides! Scotch!&mdash;not Irish native,
      at-all-at-all. People of yesterday, graziers&mdash;which tho&rsquo; they&rsquo;ve made
      the money, can&rsquo;t buy the blood. My anshestors sat on a throne, when the
      McBrides had only their <i>hunkers</i>{1} to sit upon; and if I walk now
      when they ride, they can&rsquo;t look down upon me&mdash;for every body knows
      who I am&mdash;and what they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: Their <i>hunkers</i>, i.e. their hams.}
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> To be sure, ma&rsquo;am, they do&mdash;the whole country talks of
      nothing else, but the shame when you&rsquo;d be walking and they riding.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Then could the counshillor lend me the horse?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> With all the pleasure in life, ma&rsquo;am, only every horse he has
      in the world is out o&rsquo; messages, and drawing turf and one thing or another
      to-day&mdash;and he is very sorry, ma&rsquo;am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> So am I, then&mdash;I&rsquo;m unlucky the day. But I won&rsquo;t be
      saying so, for fear of spreading ill luck on my faction. Pray now what
      kind of a fair is it?&mdash;Would there be any good signs of a fight, Mr.
      Pat Coxe?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> None in life as yet, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;only just buying and selling.
      The horse-bastes, and horned-cattle, and pigs squeaking, has it all to
      themselves. But it&rsquo;s early times yet&mdash;it won&rsquo;t be long so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> No McBrides, no Ballynavogue boys gathering yet?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> None to signify of the McBrides, ma&rsquo;am, at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Then it&rsquo;s plain them McBrides dare not be showing their
      faces, or even their backs, in Ballynavogue. But sure all our Ballynascraw
      boys, the Roonies, are in it as usual, I hope?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> Oh, ma&rsquo;am, there is plinty of Roonies. I marked Big Briny of
      Cloon, and Ulick of Eliogarty, and little Charley of Killaspugbrone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> All <i>good</i> men{1}&mdash;no better. Praise be where due.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: men who fight well.}
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> And scarce a McBride I noticed. But the father and son&mdash;ould
      Matthew, and flourishing Phil, was in it, with a new pair of boots and the
      silver-hilted whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> The spalpeen! turned into a buckeen, that would be a
      squireen,&mdash;but can&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> No, for the father pinches him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> That&rsquo;s well&mdash;and that ould Matthew is as obstinate a
      neger as ever famished his stomach. What&rsquo;s he doing in Ballynavogue the
      day?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> Standing he is there, in the fair-green with his score of fat
      bullocks, that he has got to sell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Fat bullocks! Them, I reckon, will go towards Honor
      McBride&rsquo;s portion, and a great fortin she&rsquo;ll be for a poor man&mdash;but I
      covet none of it for me or mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> I&rsquo;m sure of that, ma&rsquo;am,&mdash;you would not demane yourself
      to the likes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Mark me, Pat Coxe, now&mdash;with all them fat bullocks at
      her back, and with all them fresh roses in her cheeks&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t
      say but she&rsquo;s a likely girl, if she wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a McBride; but with all that,
      and if she was the best spinner in the three counties&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t
      say but she&rsquo;s good, if she wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a McBride;&mdash;but was she the best of
      the best, and the fairest of the fairest, and had she to boot the two
      stockings full of gould, Honor McBride shall never be brought home, a
      daughter-in-law to me! My pride&rsquo;s up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> (<i>aside</i>) And I&rsquo;m instructed to keep it up.&mdash;(<i>Aloud</i>)
      True for ye, ma&rsquo;am, and I wish that all had as much proper pride, as ought
      to be having it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> There&rsquo;s maning in your eye, Pat&mdash;give it tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> If you did not hear it, I suppose there&rsquo;s no truth in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> What?&mdash;which?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> That your son Randal, Mrs. Rooney, is not of your way of
      thinking about Honor McBride, may be&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Tut! No matter what way of thinking he is&mdash;a young slip
      of a boy like him does not know what he&rsquo;ll think to-morrow. He&rsquo;s a good
      son to me; and in regard to a wife, one girl will do him as well as
      another, if he has any sinse&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll find him a girl that will
      plase him, I&rsquo;ll engage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> May be so, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;no fear: only boys do like to be
      plasing themselves, by times&mdash;and I noticed something.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> What did you notice?&mdash;till me, Pat, dear, quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> No&mdash;&lsquo;tis bad to be meddling and remarking to get myself
      ill-will; so I&rsquo;ll keep myself to myself: for Randal&rsquo;s ready enough with
      his hand as you with the tongue&mdash;no offence, Mrs. Rooney, ma&rsquo;am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Niver fear&mdash;only till me the truth, Pat, dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> Why, then, to the best of my opinion, I seen Honor McBride
      just now giving Randal Rooney the meeting behind the chapel; and I seen
      him putting a ring on her finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> (<i>clasping her hands</i>) Oh, murder!&mdash;Oh! the
      unnat&rsquo;ral monsters that love makes of these young men; and the traitor, to
      use me so, when he promised he&rsquo;d never make a stolen match unknown&rsquo;st to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> Oh, ma&rsquo;am, I don&rsquo;t say&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t swear&mdash;it&rsquo;s a
      match yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Then I&rsquo;ll run down and stop it&mdash;and catch &lsquo;em.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> You haven&rsquo;t your jock on, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;(<i>she turns towards
      the house</i>)&mdash;and it&rsquo;s no use&mdash;for you won&rsquo;t catch &lsquo;em: I seen
      them after, turning the back way into Nick Flaherty&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Nick Flaherty&rsquo;s, the publican&rsquo;s? oh, the sinners! And this
      is the saint that Honor McBride would be passing herself upon us for? And
      all the edication she got at Mrs. Carver&rsquo;s Sunday school! Oh, this comes
      of being better than one&rsquo;s neighbours! A fine thing to tell Mrs. Carver,
      the English lady, that&rsquo;s so nice, and so partial to Miss Honor McBride!
      Oh, I&rsquo;ll expose her!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> Oh! sure, Mrs. Rooney, you promised you&rsquo;d not tell, (<i>Standing
      so as to stop CATTY.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Is it who told me? No&mdash;I won&rsquo;t mintion a sintence of
      your name. But let me by&mdash;I won&rsquo;t be put off now I&rsquo;ve got the scent.
      I&rsquo;ll hunt &lsquo;em out, and drag her to shame, if they&rsquo;re above ground, or my
      name&rsquo;s not Catty Rooney! Mick! Mick! little Mick! (<i>calling at the
      cottage door</i>) bring my blue <i>jock</i> up the road after me to
      Ballynavogue. Don&rsquo;t let me count three till you&rsquo;re after me, or I&rsquo;ll bleed
      ye! (<i>Exit CATTY, shaking her closed hand, and repeating</i>) I&rsquo;ll
      expose Honor McBride&mdash;I&rsquo;ll expose Honor! I will, by the blessing!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> (<i>alone</i>) Now, if Randal Rooney would hear, he&rsquo;d make a
      jelly of me, and how I&rsquo;d trimble; or the brother, if he comed across me,
      and knewed. But they&rsquo;ll niver know. Oh, Catty won&rsquo;t say a sintence of my
      name, was she carded! No, Catty&rsquo;s a scould, but has a conscience. Then I
      like conscience in them I have to dale with sartainly. {<i>Exit.</i>

    <p>
      <i>Mrs. CARVER&rsquo;S Dressing-room, HONOR McBRIDE and MISS BLOOMSBURY
      discovered.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> How <i>will</i> I know, Miss Bloomsbury, when it will be
      twelve o&rsquo;clock?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> You&rsquo;ll hear the clock strike: but I suspect you&rsquo;se don&rsquo;t
      understand the clock yet&mdash;well, you&rsquo;ll hear the workmen&rsquo;s bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> I know, ma&rsquo;am, oh, I know, true&mdash;only I was flurried,
      so I forgot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> Flurried! but never be flurried. Now mind and keep your head
      upon your shoulders, while I tell you all your duty&mdash;you&rsquo;ll just
      ready this here room, your lady&rsquo;s dressing-room; not a partical of dust
      let me never find, petticlarly behind the vindor shuts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Vindor shuts!&mdash;where, ma&rsquo;am?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> The <i>shuts</i> of the <i>vindors</i>&mdash;did you never
      hear of a vindor, child?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Never, ma&rsquo;am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> (<i>pointing to a window</i>) Don&rsquo;t tell me! why, your head
      is a wool-gathering! Now, mind me, pray&mdash;see here, always you put
      that there,&mdash;and this here, and that upon that,&mdash;and this upon
      this, and this under that,&mdash;and that under this&mdash;you can
      remember that much, child, I supposes?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> I&rsquo;ll do my endeavour, ma&rsquo;am, to remember all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> But mind, now, my good girl, you takes <i>petticlar</i> care
      of this here pyramint of japanned china&mdash;and <i>very</i> petticlar
      care of that there great joss&mdash;and the <i>very most petticularest</i>
      care of this here right reverend Mandolin. (<i>Pointing to, and touching a
      Mandarin, so as to make it shake. HONOR starts back.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> It i&rsquo;n&rsquo;t alive. Silly child, to start at a Mandolin shaking
      his head and beard at you. But, oh! mercy, if there i&rsquo;n&rsquo;t enough to make
      him shake his head. Stand there!&mdash;stand here!&mdash;now don&rsquo;t you
      see?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> <i>Which</i>, ma&rsquo;am?

    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> &ldquo;<i>Which, ma&rsquo;am!</i>&rdquo; you&rsquo;re no <i>witch</i>, indeed, if
      you don&rsquo;t see a cobweb as long as my arm. Run, run, child, for the pope&rsquo;s
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Pope&rsquo;s head, ma&rsquo;am?
    </p>

      <i>Bloom.</i> Ay, the pope&rsquo;s head, which you&rsquo;ll find under the stairs.
      Well, a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you gone? what do you stand there like a stuck pig, for?&mdash;Never
      see a pope&rsquo;s head?&mdash;never &lsquo;ear of a pope&rsquo;s head?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> I&rsquo;ve heard of one, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;with the priest; but we are
      protestants.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bloom.</i> Protestants! what&rsquo;s that to do? I do protest, I believe that
      little head of yours is someway got wrong on your shoulders to-day. {<i>The
      clock strikes</i>&mdash;HONOR, <i>who is close to it, starts.</i>

      <i>Bloom.</i> Start again!&mdash;why, you&rsquo;re all starts and fits. Never
      start, child! so ignoramus like! &lsquo;tis only the clock in your ear,&mdash;twelve
      o&rsquo;clock, hark!&mdash;The bell will ring now in a hurry. Then you goes in
      there to my lady&mdash;stay, you&rsquo;ll never be able, I dare for to say, for
      to open the door without me; for I opine you are not much usen&rsquo;d to brass
      locks in Hirish cabins&mdash;can&rsquo;t be expected. See here, then! You turns
      the lock in your hand this&rsquo;n ways&mdash;the lock, mind now; not the key
      nor the bolt for your life, child, else you&rsquo;d bolt your lady in, and
      there&rsquo;d be my lady in Lob&rsquo;s pound, and there&rsquo;d be a pretty kettle, of
      fish!&mdash;So you keep, if you can, all I said to you in your head, if
      possible&mdash;and you goes in there&mdash;and I goes out here.

      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Nobody should know that better than Mr. Carver of Bob&rsquo;s Fort&mdash;he
      knows all my affairs. He is an undeniable honest gentleman, for whom I
      profess the highest regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Why then he has a great opinion of you too, counsellor&mdash;for
      he has been advising of, and telling of me, O&rsquo;Blaney, of your proposhal,
      sir&mdash;and very sinsible I am of the honour done by you to our family,
      sir&mdash;and condescension to the likes of us&mdash;though, to be sure,
      Honor McBride, though she is my daughter, is a match for any man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Is a match for a prince&mdash;a Prince Ragent even. So no
      more about condescension, my good Matthew, for love livels all
      distinctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> That&rsquo;s very pretty of you to say so, sir; and I&rsquo;ll repeat
      it to Honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Cupid is the great liveller, after all, and the only
      democrat Daity on earth I&rsquo;d bow to&mdash;for I know you are no democrat,
      Mr. McBride, but quite and clane the contrary way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Quite and clane and stiff, I thank my God; and I&rsquo;m glad,
      in spite of the vowel before your name, Mr. O&rsquo;Blaney, to hear you are of
      the same kidney.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> I&rsquo;m happy to find myself agreeable to you, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> But, however agreeable to me, as I won&rsquo;t deny, it might
      be, sir, to see my girl made into a gentlewoman by marriage, I must
      observe to you&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> And I&rsquo;ll keep her a jaunting car to ride about the country;
      and in another year, as my fortune&rsquo;s rising, my wife should rise with it
      into a coach of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Oh! if I&rsquo;d live to see my child, my Honor, in a coach of
      her own! I&rsquo;d be too happy&mdash;oh, I&rsquo;d die contint!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> (<i>aside</i>) No fear!&mdash;(<i>Aloud</i>) And why should
      not she ride in her own coach, Mistress Counsellor O&rsquo;Blaney, and look out
      of the windows down upon the <i>Roonies</i>, that have the insolence to
      look up to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Ah! you know <i>that</i>, then. That&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s against
      us, sir, in this match.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> But if <i>you</i> are against Randal, no fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> I am against him&mdash;that is, against his family, and
      all his seed, breed, and generation. But I would not break my daughter&rsquo;s
      heart if I could help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Wheugh!&mdash;hearts don&rsquo;t break in these days, like china.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> This is my answer, Mr. O&rsquo;Blaney, sir: you have my lave,
      but you must have hers too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> I would not fear to gain that in due time, if you would
      stand my friend in forbidding her the sight of Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> I will with pleasure, that&mdash;for tho&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t force
      her to marry to plase me, I&rsquo;ll forbid her to marry to displase me; and
      when I&rsquo;ve said it, whatever it is, I&rsquo;ll be obeyed. (<i>Strikes his stick
      on the ground.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> That is all I ax.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> But now what settlement, counshillor, will you make on my
      girl?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> A. hundred a year&mdash;I wish to be liberal&mdash;Mr.
      Carver will see to that&mdash;he knows all my affairs, as I suppose he was
      telling you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> He was&mdash;I&rsquo;m satisfied, and I&rsquo;m at a word myself
      always. You heard me name my girl&rsquo;s portion, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> I can&rsquo;t say&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mind&mdash;&lsquo;twas no object to me
      in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> (<i>in a very low, mysterious tone, and slow brogue</i>)
      Then five hundred guineas is some object to most men.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Certainly, sir; but not such an object as your daughter to
      me: since we are got upon business, however, best settle all that out of
      the way, as you say at once. Of the five hundred, I have two in my hands
      already, which you can make over to me with a stroke of a pen. (<i>Rising
      quickly, and getting pen, ink, and books.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> (<i>speaking very slowly</i>) Stay a hit&mdash;no hurry&mdash;in
      life. In business&mdash;&lsquo;tis always most haste, worse speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Take your own time, my good Matthew&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be as slow as
      you plase&mdash;only love&rsquo;s quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Slow and sure&mdash;love and all&mdash;fast bind, fast
      find&mdash;three and two, what does that make?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> It used to make five before I was in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> And will the same after you&rsquo;re married and dead. What am I
      thinking of? A score of bullocks I had in the fair&mdash;half a score sold
      in my pocket, and owing half&mdash;that&rsquo;s John Dolan, twelve pound tin&mdash;and
      Charley Duffy nine guineas and thirteen tin pinnies and a five-penny bit:
      stay, then, put that to the hundred guineas in the stocking at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> (<i>aside</i>) How he makes my mouth water: (<i>Aloud</i>)
      May be, Matthew, I could, that am used to it, save you the trouble of
      counting?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> No trouble in life to me ever to count my money&mdash;only
      I&rsquo;ll trouble you, sir, if you please, to lock that door; bad to be
      chinking and spreading money with doors open, for walls has ears and eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> True for you. (<i>Rising, and going to lock the doors.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>Old McBRIDE with great difficulty, and very slowly, draws out of his
      pocket his bag of money&mdash;looking first at one door, and then at the
      other, and going to try whether they are locked, before he unties his bag.</i>}
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> (<i>spreads and counts his money and notes</i>) See me
      now, I wrote on some scrap somewhere 59<i>l.</i> in notes&mdash;then hard
      cash, twinty pounds&mdash;rolled up silver and gould, which is scarce&mdash;but
      of a hundred pounds there&rsquo;s wanting fourteen pounds odd, I think, or
      something that way; for Phil and I had our breakfast out of a one pound
      note of Finlay&rsquo;s, and I put the change somewhere&mdash;besides a riband
      for Honor, which make a deficiency of fourteen pounds seven shillings and
      two pence&mdash;that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s deficient&mdash;count it which way you will.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> (<i>going to sweep the money off the table</i>) Oh! never
      mind the deficiency&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take it for a hundred plump.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> (<i>stopping him</i>) Plump me no plumps&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have
      it exact, or not at all&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not part it, so let me see it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> (<i>aside with a deep sigh, almost a groan</i>) Oh! when I
      had had it in my fist&mdash;almost: but &lsquo;tis as hard to get money out of
      this man as blood out of a turnip; and I&rsquo;ll be lost to-night without it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> &lsquo;Tis not exact&mdash;and I&rsquo;m exact: I&rsquo;ll put it all up
      again&mdash;(<i>he puts it deliberately into the bag again, thrusting the
      bag into his pocket</i>)&mdash;I&rsquo;ll make it up at home my own way, and
      send it in to you by Phil in an hour&rsquo;s time; for I could not sleep sound
      with so much in my house&mdash;bad people about&mdash;safer with you in
      town. Mr. Carver says, you are as good as the Bank of Ireland&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      no going beyond that. (<i>Buttoning up his pockets.</i>) So you may unlock
      the doors and let me out now&mdash;I&rsquo;ll send Phil with all to you, and
      you&rsquo;ll give him a bit of a receipt or a token, that would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> I shall give a receipt by all means&mdash;all regular: short
      accounts make long friends. (<i>Unlocks the door.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> True, sir, and I&rsquo;ll come in and see about the settlements
      in the morning, if Honor is agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> I shall make it my business to wait upon the young lady
      myself on the wings of love; and I trust I&rsquo;ll not find any remains of
      Randal Rooney in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Not if I can help it, depend on that. (<i>They shake
      hands.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Then, fare ye well, father-in-law&mdash;that&rsquo;s meat and
      drink to me: would not ye take a glass of wine then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Not a drop&mdash;not a drop at all&mdash;with money about
      me: I must be in a hurry home.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> That&rsquo;s true&mdash;so best: recommind me kindly to Miss
      Honor, and say a great dale about my impatience&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll be
      expicting Phil, and won&rsquo;t shut up till he comes the night.

      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> (<i>calling</i>) Dan! open the door, there: Dan! Joe! open
      the door smart for Mr. McBride! (O&rsquo;BLANEY <i>rubbing his hands.</i>) Now I

      here&rsquo;s Pat too! Well, Pat Coxe, what news of the thing in hand?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter PAT COXE.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> Out of hand clane! that job&rsquo;s nately done. The turf-rick, sir,
      &lsquo;s built up cliver, with the malt snug in the middle of its stomach&mdash;so
      were the shupervishor a conjuror even, barring he&rsquo;d dale with the ould
      one, he&rsquo;d never suspict a sentence of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Not he&mdash;he&rsquo;s no conjuror: many&rsquo;s the dozen tricks I
      played him afore now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> But, counshillor, there&rsquo;s the big veshel in the little passage&mdash;I
      got a hint from a friend, that the shuper got information of the spirits
      in that from some villain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> And do you think I don&rsquo;t know a trick for that, too?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> No doubt: still, counshillor, I&rsquo;m in dread of my life that
      that great big veshel won&rsquo;t be implied in a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Won&rsquo;t it? but you&rsquo;ll see it will, though; and what&rsquo;s more,
      them spirits will turn into water for the shupervisor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> Water! how?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Asy&mdash;the ould tan-pit that&rsquo;s at the back of the
      distillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> I know&mdash;what of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> A sacret pipe I&rsquo;ve got fixed to the big veshel, and the pipe
      goes under the wall for me into the tan-pit, and a sucker I have in the
      big veshel, which I pull open by a string in a crack, and lets all off all
      clane into the tan-pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> That&rsquo;s capital!&mdash;but the water?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> From the pump, another pipe&mdash;and the girl&rsquo;s pumping
      asy, for she&rsquo;s to wash to-morrow, and knows nothing about it; and so the
      big veshel she fills with water, wondering what ails the water that it
      don&rsquo;t come&mdash;and I set one boy and another to help her&mdash;and the
      pump&rsquo;s bewitched, and that&rsquo;s all:&mdash;so that&rsquo;s settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> And cliverly. Oh! counshillor, we are a match for the shuper
      any day or night.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> For him and all his tribe, <i>coursing</i> officers and all.
      I&rsquo;d desire no better sport than to hear the whole pack in full cry after
      me, and I doubling, and doubling, and safe at my form at last. With you,
      Pat, my precious, to drag the herring over the ground previous to the
      hunt, to distract the scent, and defy the nose of the dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> Then I am proud to sarve you, counshillor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> I know you are, and a very honest boy. And what did you do
      for me, with Catty Rooney?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> The best.&mdash;Oh! it&rsquo;s I <i>blarny&rsquo;d</i> Catty to the skies,
      and then egged her on, and aggravated her against the McBrides, till I
      left her as mad as e&rsquo;er a one in Bedlam&mdash;up to any thing! And full
      tilt she&rsquo;s off to Flaherty&rsquo;s, the publican, in her blue jock&mdash;where
      she&rsquo;ll not be long afore she kicks up a quarrel, I&rsquo;ll engage; for she&rsquo;s
      sarching the house for Honor McBride, who is <i>not</i> in it&mdash;and
      giving bad language, I warrant, to all the McBride faction, who <i>is</i>
      in it, drinking. Oh! trust Catty&rsquo;s tongue for breeding a riot! In half an
      hour, I&rsquo;ll warrant, you&rsquo;ll have as fine a fight in town as ever ye seen or
      <i>hard</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> That&rsquo;s iligantly done, Pat. But I hope Randal Rooney is in
      it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> In the thick of it he is, or will be. So I hope your honour
      did not forgit to spake to Mr. Carver about that little place for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Forgit!&mdash;Do I forgit my own name, do you think? Sooner
      forgit that <i>then</i> my promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> Oh! I beg your honour&rsquo;s pardon&mdash;I would not doubt your
      word; and to make matters sure, and to make Catty cockahoop, I tould her,
      and swore to her, there was not a McBride in the town but two, and there&rsquo;s
      twinty, more or less.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> And when she sees them twinty, more or less, what will she
      think?&mdash;Why would you say that?&mdash;she might find you out in a lie
      next minute, Mr. Overdo. &lsquo;Tis dangerous for a young man to be telling more
      lies than is absolutely requisite. The <i>lie superfluous</i> brings many
      an honest man, and, what&rsquo;s more, many a cliver fellow, into a scrape&mdash;and
      that&rsquo;s your great fau&rsquo;t, Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> Which, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> <i>That</i>, sir. I don&rsquo;t see you often now take a glass too
      much. But, Pat, I hear you often still are too apt to indulge in a lie too
      much.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> Lie! Is it I?&mdash;Whin upon my conscience, I niver to my
      knowledge tould a lie in my life, since I was born, excipt it would be
      just to skreen a man, which is charity, sure,&mdash;or to skreen myself,
      which is self-defence, sure&mdash;and that&rsquo;s lawful; or to oblige your
      honour, by particular desire, and <i>that</i> can&rsquo;t be helped, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> I am not saying again all that&mdash;only (<i>laying his
      hand on</i> PAT&rsquo;S <i>shoulder as he is going out</i>) against another
      time, all I&rsquo;m warning you, young man, is, you&rsquo;re too apt to think there

      sir:&mdash;promised clerk&rsquo;s place?&mdash;I do not conceive what you are
      aiming at, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> The little clerk&rsquo;s place, plase your honour&mdash;that my
      master, Counshillor O&rsquo;Blaney, tould me he spoke about to your honour, and
      was recommending me for to your honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Never&mdash;never heard one syllable about it, till this
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> Oh! murder:&mdash;but I expict your honour&rsquo;s goodness will&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> To make your mind easy, I promised to appoint a young man
      to that place, a week ago, by Counsellor O&rsquo;Blaney&rsquo;s special
      recommendation. So there must be some mistake.

      <i>Pat.</i> Mistake? ay, mistake on purpose. So he never spoke! so he
      lied!&mdash;my master that was praching me! And oh, the dirty lie he tould
      me! Now I can&rsquo;t put up with that, when I was almost perjuring myself for
      him at the time. Oh, if I don&rsquo;t fit him for this! And he got the place
      given to another!&mdash;then I&rsquo;ll git him as well sarved, and out of this
      place too&mdash;seen-if-I-don&rsquo;t! He is cunning enough, but I&rsquo;m cuter nor
      he&mdash;I have him in my power, so I have! and I&rsquo;ll give the shupervizor
      a scent of the malt in the turf-stack&mdash;and a hint of the spirits in
      the tan-pit&mdash;and it&rsquo;s I that will like to stand by innocent, and see
      how shrunk O&rsquo;Blaney&rsquo;s double face will look forenent the shupervizor, when
      all&rsquo;s found out, and not a word left to say, but to pay&mdash;ruined hand
      and foot! Then that shall be, and before nightfall. Oh! one good turn
      desarves another&mdash;in revenge, prompt payment while you live!

      SCENE II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>McBRIDE&rsquo;S Cottage.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>MATTHEW McBRIDE and HONOR. (MATTHEW with a little table before him, at
      dinner.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> (<i>pushing his plate from him</i>) I&rsquo;ll take no more&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      done. {<i>He sighs.</i>}
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Then you made but a poor dinner, father, after being at the
      fair, and up early, and all!&mdash;Take this bit from my hands, father
      dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> (<i>turning away sullenly</i>) I&rsquo;ll take nothing from you,
      Honor, but what I got already enough&mdash;and too much of&mdash;and
      that&rsquo;s ungratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Ungratitude, father! then you don&rsquo;t see my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> I lave that to whoever has it, Honor: &lsquo;tis enough for me,
      I see what you do&mdash;and that&rsquo;s what I go by.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Oh, me! and what did I do to displase you, father? (<i>He is
      obstinately silent; after waiting in vain for an answer, she continues</i>)
      I that was thinking to make all happy, (<i>aside</i>) but myself, (<i>aloud</i>)
      by settling to keep out of the way of&mdash;all that could vex you&mdash;and
      to go to sarvice, to Mrs. Carver&rsquo;s. I thought that would plase you,
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Is it to lave me, Honor? Is it <i>that</i> you thought
      would plase me, Honor?&mdash;To lave your father alone in his ould age,
      after all the slaving he got and was willing to undergo, whilst ever he
      had strength, early and late, to make a little portion for you, Honor,&mdash;you,
      that I reckoned upon for the prop and pride of my ould age&mdash;and you
      expect you&rsquo;d plase me by laving me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Hear me just if, pray then, father.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> (<i>shaking her off as she tries to caress him</i>) Go,
      then; go where you will, and demane yourself going into sarvice, rather
      than stay with me&mdash;go.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> No, I&rsquo;ll not go. I&rsquo;ll stay then with you, father dear,&mdash;say
      that will plase you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> (<i>going on without listening to her</i>) And all for the
      love of this Randal Rooney! Ay, you may well put your two hands before
      your face; if you&rsquo;d any touch of natural affection at all, <i>that</i>
      young man would have been the last of all others you&rsquo;d ever have thought
      of loving or liking any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Oh! if I could help it!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> There it is. This is the way the poor fathers is always to
      be trated. They to give all, daughter and all, and get nothing at all, not
      their choice even of the man, the villain that&rsquo;s to rob &lsquo;em of all&mdash;without
      thanks even; and of all the plinty of bachelors there are in the parish
      for the girl that has money, that daughter will go and pick and choose out
      the very man the father mislikes beyond all others, and then it&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Oh!
      if I could help it</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;Asy talking!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> But, dear father, wasn&rsquo;t it more than talk, what I did?&mdash;Oh,
      won&rsquo;t you listen to me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB</i> I&rsquo;ll not hear ye; for if you&rsquo;d a grain o spirit in your
      mane composition, Honor, you would take your father&rsquo;s part, and not be
      putting yourself under Catty&rsquo;s feet&mdash;the bad-tongued woman, that
      hates you, Honor, like poison.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> If she does hate me, it&rsquo;s all through love of her own&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Son&mdash;ay&mdash;that she thinks too good for you&mdash;for
      <i>you</i>, Honor; you, the Lily of Lismore&mdash;that might command the
      pride of the country. Oh! Honor dear, don&rsquo;t be lessening yourself; but be
      a proud girl, as you ought, and my own Honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Oh, when you speak so kind!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> And I beg your pardon, if I said a cross word; for I know
      you&rsquo;ll never think of him more, and no need to lave home at all for his
      sake. It would be a shame in the country, and what would Mrs. Carver
      herself think?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> She thinks well of it, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Then whatever she thinks, she sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have my child from
      me! tho&rsquo; she&rsquo;s a very good lady, and a very kind lady, too. But see now,
      Honor&mdash;have done with love, for it&rsquo;s all foolishness; and when you
      come to be as ould as I am, you&rsquo;ll think so too. The shadows goes all one
      way, till the middle of the day, and when that is past, then all the
      t&rsquo;other way; and so it is with love, in life&mdash;stay till the sun is
      going down with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Then it would be too late to be thinking of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> And too airly now, and there&rsquo;s no good time, for it&rsquo;s all
      folly. I&rsquo;ll ax you, will love set the potatoes?&mdash;will love make the
      rent?&mdash;or will love give you a jaunting car?&mdash;as to my
      knowledge, another of your bachelors would.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Oh, don&rsquo;t name him, father.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Why not&mdash;when it&rsquo;s his name that would make a lady of
      you, and there&rsquo;d be a rise in life, and an honour to your family?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Recollect it was he that would have dishonoured my family,
      in me, if he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> But he repints now; and what can a man do but repint, and
      offer to make honourable restitution, and thinking of marrying, as now,
      Honor dear;&mdash;is not that a condescension of he, who&rsquo;s a sort of a
      jantleman?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> A sort, indeed&mdash;a bad sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Why, not jantleman <i>born</i>, to be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Nor <i>bred.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Well, there&rsquo;s many that way, neither born nor bred, but
      that does very well in the world; and think what it would be to live in
      the big shingled house, in Ballynavogue, with him!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> I&rsquo;d rather live here with you, father.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Then I thank you kindly, daughter, for that, but so would
      not <i>I for</i> you,&mdash;and then the jaunting-car, or a coach, in
      time, if he could! He has made the proposhal for you in form this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> And what answer from you, father?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Don&rsquo;t be looking so pale,&mdash;I tould him he had my
      consint, if he could get yours. And, oh! before you speak, Honor dear,
      think what it would be up and down in Ballynavogue, and every other place
      in the county, assizes days and all, to be Mistress Gerald O&rsquo;Blaney!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> I couldn&rsquo;t but think very ill of it, father; thinking ill,
      as I do, of him. Father dear, say no more, don&rsquo;t be breaking my heart&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      never have that man; but I&rsquo;ll stay happy with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Why, then, I&rsquo;ll be contint with that same; and who
      wouldn&rsquo;t?&mdash;If it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d rather stay, and <i>can</i> stay
      contint, Honor dear, I&rsquo;m only too happy. (<i>Embracing her&mdash;then
      pausing.</i>) But for Randal&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> In what can you fau&rsquo;t him, only his being a Rooney?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> That&rsquo;s all&mdash;but that&rsquo;s enough. I&rsquo;d sooner see you in
      your coffin&mdash;sooner be at your wake to-night, than your wedding with
      a Rooney! &lsquo;Twould kill me. Come, promise me&mdash;I&rsquo;d trust your word&mdash;and
      &lsquo;twould make me asy for life, and I&rsquo;d die asy, if you&rsquo;d promise never to
      have him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Never till you would consent&mdash;that&rsquo;s all I can promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Well, that same is a great ase to my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> And to give a little ase to mine, father, perhaps you could
      promise&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> What?&mdash;I&rsquo;ll promise nothing at all&mdash;I&rsquo;ll promise
      nothing at all&mdash;I&rsquo;ll promise nothing I couldn&rsquo;t perform.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> But this you could perform asy, dear father: just hear your
      own Honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> (<i>aside</i>) That voice would wheedle the bird off the
      bush&mdash;and when she&rsquo;d prefar me to the jaunting-car, can I but listen
      to her? (<i>Aloud</i>) Well, what?&mdash;if it&rsquo;s any thing at all in
      rason.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> It is in rason entirely. It&rsquo;s only, that if Catty Rooney&rsquo;s&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> (<i>stopping his ears</i>) Don&rsquo;t name her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> But she might be brought to rason, father; and if she should
      be brought to give up that claim to the bit o&rsquo; bog of yours, and when all
      differs betwix&rsquo; the families be made up, then you would consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> When Catty Rooney&rsquo;s brought to rason! Oh! go shoe the
      goslings, dear,&mdash;ay, you&rsquo;ll get my consint then. There&rsquo;s my hand: I
      promise you, I&rsquo;ll never be called on to perform that, Honor, jewel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> (<i>kissing his hand</i>) Then that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;d ask&mdash;nor
      will I say one word more, but thank you, father.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> (<i>putting on his coat</i>) She&rsquo;s a good cratur&mdash;sorrow
      better! sister or daughter. Oh! I won&rsquo;t forget that she prefarred me to
      the jaunting-car. Phil shall carry him a civil refusal. I&rsquo;ll send off the
      money, the three hundred, by your brother, this minute&mdash;that will be
      some comfort to poor O&rsquo;Blaney.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>Exit McBRIDE.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Is not he a kind father, then, after all?&mdash;That promise
      he gave me about Catty, even such as it is, has ased my heart wonderfully.
      Oh! it will all come right, and they&rsquo;ll all be rasonable in time, even
      Catty Rooney, I&rsquo;ve great hope; and little hope&rsquo;s enough, even for love to
      live upon. But, hark! there&rsquo;s my brother Phil coming. (<i>A noise heard in
      the back-house.</i>) &lsquo;Tis only the cow in the bier. (<i>A knock heard at
      the door.</i>) No, &lsquo;tis a Christian; no cow ever knocked so soft. Stay
      till I open&mdash;Who&rsquo;s in it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> (<i>from within</i>) Your own Randal&mdash;open quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Oh! Randal, is it you? I can&rsquo;t open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>She holds the door&mdash;he pushes it half open.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> Honor, that I love more than life, let me in, till I speak
      one word to you, before you&rsquo;re set against me for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> No danger of that&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t let you in, Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> Great danger! Honor, and you must. See you I will, if I die
      for it!
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>He advances, and she retires behind the door, holding it against him.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Then I won&rsquo;t see you this month again, if you do. My hand&rsquo;s
      weak, but my heart&rsquo;s strong, Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> Then my heart&rsquo;s as weak as a child&rsquo;s this minute. Never
      fear&mdash;don&rsquo;t hold against me, Honor; I&rsquo;ll stand where I am, since you
      don&rsquo;t trust me, nor love me&mdash;and best so, may be: I only wanted to
      say three words to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> I can&rsquo;t hear you now, Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> Then you&rsquo;ll never hear me more. Good bye to you, Honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>He pulls the door to, angrily.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> And it&rsquo;s a wonder as it was you didn&rsquo;t meet my father as you
      came, or my brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> (<i>pushing the door a little open again</i>) Your brother!&mdash;Oh,
      Honor! that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s breaking my heart&mdash;(<i>he sighs</i>)&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      what I wanted to say to you; and listen to me. No fear of your father,
      he&rsquo;s gone down the road: I saw him as I come the short cut, but he didn&rsquo;t
      see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> What of my brother?&mdash;say, and go.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> Ay, go&mdash;for ever, you&rsquo;ll bid me, when I&rsquo;ve said.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> What! oh, speak, or I&rsquo;ll drop.&mdash;(<i>She no longer holds
      the door, but leans against a table.&mdash;RANDAL advances, and looks in.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> Don&rsquo;t be frightened, then, dearest&mdash;it&rsquo;s nothing in
      life but a fight at a fair. He&rsquo;s but little hurted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Hurted!&mdash;and by who? by you, is it?&mdash;Then all&rsquo;s
      over.&mdash;(<i>RANDAL comes quite in&mdash;HONOR, putting her hand before
      her eyes.</i>)&mdash;You may come or go, for I&rsquo;ll never love you more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> I expicted as much!&mdash;But she&rsquo;ll faint!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> I won&rsquo;t faint: leave me, Mr. Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> Take this water from me, (<i>holding a cup</i>) it&rsquo;s all I
      ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> No need. (<i>She sits down</i>) But what&rsquo;s this?&mdash;(<i>Seeing
      his hand bound up.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> A cut only.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Bleeding&mdash;stop it. (<i>Turning from him coldly.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> Then by this blood&mdash;no, not by this worthless blood of
      mine&mdash;but by that dearest blood that fled from your cheeks, and this
      minute is coming back, Honor, I swear&mdash;(<i>kneeling to her.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Say what you will, or swear, I don&rsquo;t hear or heed you. And
      my father will come and find you there&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t care.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> I know you don&rsquo;t&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t care myself what happens
      me. But as to Phil, it&rsquo;s only a cut in the head he got, that signifies
      nothing&mdash;if he was not your brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Once lifted your hand against him&mdash;all&rsquo;s over.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> Honor, I did not lift my hand against <i>him</i>; but I was
      in the quarrel with his faction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> And this your promise to me not to be in any quarrel! No, if
      my father consented to-morrow, I&rsquo;d nivir have you now. (<i>Rises, and is
      going&mdash;he holds her.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> Then you&rsquo;re wrong, Honor: you&rsquo;ve heard all against me&mdash;now
      hear what&rsquo;s for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> I&rsquo;ll hear no more&mdash;let me go.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> Go, then; (<i>he lets her go, and turns away himself</i>)
      and I&rsquo;m going before Mr. Carver, who <i>will</i> hear me, and the truth
      will appear&mdash;and tho&rsquo; not from you, Honor, I&rsquo;ll have justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>Exit RANDAL.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Justice! Oh, worse and worse! to make all public; and if

    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;BLANEY&rsquo;S House.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;BLANEY and CATTY ROONEY.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> And didn&rsquo;t ye hear it, counshillor? the uproar in the town
      and the riot?&mdash;oh! you&rsquo;d think the world was throwing out at windows.
      See my jock, all tattered! Didn&rsquo;t ye hear!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> How could I hear, backwards, as you see, from the street,
      and given up to my business?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Business! oh! here is a fine business&mdash;the McBrides
      have driven all before them, and chased the Roonies out of Ballynavogue. (<i>In
      a tone of deep despair.</i>) Oh! Catty Rooney! that ever you&rsquo;d live to see
      this day!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Then take this glass (<i>offering a glass of whiskey</i>) to
      comfort your heart, my good Mrs. Rooney.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> No, thank you, counshillor, it&rsquo;s past that even! ogh! ogh!&mdash;oh!
      wirrastrew!&mdash;oh! wirrastrew, ogh!&mdash;(<i>After wringing her hands,
      and yielding to a burst of sorrow and wailing, she stands up firmly.</i>)
      Now I&rsquo;ve ased my heart, I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ve spirit enough left in me yet, you&rsquo;ll
      see; and I&rsquo;ll tell you what I came to you for, counshillor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Tell me first, is Randal Rooney in it, and is he hurt?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> He was in it: he&rsquo;s not hurt, more shame for him! But,
      howsomever, he bet one boy handsomely; that&rsquo;s my only comfort. Our
      faction&rsquo;s all going full drive to swear examinations, and get justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Very proper&mdash;very proper: swear examinations&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      the course, and only satisfaction in these cases to get justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Justice!&mdash;revenge sure! Oh! revenge is sweet, and I&rsquo;ll
      have it. Counshillor dear, I never went before Mr. Carver&mdash;you know
      him, sir&mdash;what sort is he?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> A mighty good sort of gentleman&mdash;only mighty tiresome.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Ay, that&rsquo;s what I hard&mdash;that he is mighty fond of
      talking to people for their good. Now that&rsquo;s what I dread, for I can&rsquo;t
      stand being talked to for my good.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> &lsquo;Tis little use, I confess. We Irish is wonderful soon tired
      of goodness, if there&rsquo;s no spice of fun along with it; and poor Carver&rsquo;s
      soft, and between you and I, he&rsquo;s a little bothered, but, Mrs. Rooney, you
      won&rsquo;t repate?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Repate!&mdash;I! I&rsquo;m neither watch nor repater&mdash;I scorn
      both; and between you and I, since you say so, counshillor, that&rsquo;s my
      chiefest objection to Carver, whom I wouldn&rsquo;t know from Adam, except by
      reputation. But it&rsquo;s the report of the country, that he has common
      informers in his pay and favour; now that&rsquo;s mane, and I don&rsquo;t like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Nor I, Mrs. Rooney. I had experience of informers in the
      distillery line once. The worst varmin that is ever encouraged in any
      house or country. The very mintion of them makes me creep all over still.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Then &lsquo;tis Carver, they say, that has the oil of Rhodium for
      them; for they follow and fawn on him, like rats on the rat catcher&mdash;of
      all sorts and sizes, he has &lsquo;em. They say, he sets them over and after one
      another; and has <i>lations</i> of them that he lets out on the craturs&rsquo; 
      cabins, to larn how many grains of salt every man takes with his little <i>prates</i>,
      and bring information if a straw would be stirring.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Ay, and if it would, then, it&rsquo;s Carver that would quake like
      the aspin leaf&mdash;I know that. It&rsquo;s no malice at all in him; only just
      he&rsquo;s a mighty great poltroon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Is that all? Then I&rsquo;d pity and laugh at him, and I go to him
      preferably to any other magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> You may, Mrs. Rooney&mdash;for it&rsquo;s in terror of his life he
      lives, continually draming day and night, and croaking of carders and
      thrashers, and oak boys, and white boys, and peep-o&rsquo;-day boys, and united
      boys, and riband-men, and men and boys of all sorts that have, and that
      have not, been up and down the country since the rebellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> The poor cratur! But in case he&rsquo;d prove refractory, and
      would not take my examinations, can&rsquo;t I persecute my shute again the
      McBrides for the bit of the bog of Ballynascraw, counshillor?&mdash;Can&rsquo;t
      I <i>harash</i> &lsquo;em at law?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> You can, ma&rsquo;am, harash them properly. I&rsquo;ve looked over your
      papers, and I&rsquo;m happy to tell you, you may go on at law as soon and as
      long as you plase.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> (<i>speaking very rapidly</i>) Bless you for that word,
      counshillor; and by the first light to-morrow, I&rsquo;ll drive all the grazing
      cattle, every four-footed <i>baast</i> off the land, and pound &lsquo;em in
      Ballynavogue; and if they replevy, why I&rsquo;ll distrain again, if it be forty
      times, I will go. I&rsquo;ll go on distraining, and I&rsquo;ll advertise, and I&rsquo;ll
      cant, and I&rsquo;ll sell the distress at the end of the eight days. And if they
      dare for to go for to put a plough in that bit of reclaimed bog, I&rsquo;ll come
      down upon &lsquo;em with an injunction, and I would not value the expinse of
      bringing down a record a pin&rsquo;s pint; and if that went again me, I&rsquo;d remove
      it to the courts above and wilcome; and after that, I&rsquo;d go into equity,
      and if the chancillor would not be my friend, I&rsquo;d take it over to the
      House of Lords in London, so I would as soon as look at &lsquo;em; for I&rsquo;d wear
      my feet to the knees for justice&mdash;so I would.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> That you would! You&rsquo;re an iligant lawyer, Mrs. Rooney; but
      have you the sinews of war?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Is it money, dear?&mdash;I have, and while ever I&rsquo;ve one
      shilling to throw down to ould Matthew McBride&rsquo;s guinea, I&rsquo;ll go on; and
      every guinea he parts will twinge his vitals: so I&rsquo;ll keep on while ever
      I&rsquo;ve a fiv&rsquo;-penny bit to rub on another&mdash;for my spirit is up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Ay, ay, so you say. Catty, my dear, your back&rsquo;s asy up, but
      it&rsquo;s asy down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Not when I&rsquo;ve been trod on as now, counshillor: it&rsquo;s then
      I&rsquo;d turn and fly at a body, gentle or simple, like mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Well done, Catty (<i>patting her on the back</i>). There&rsquo;s
      my own pet mad cat&mdash;and there&rsquo;s a legal venom in her claws, that
      every scratch they&rsquo;ll give shall fester so no plaister in law can heal it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Oh, counshillor, now, if you wouldn&rsquo;t be flattering a wake
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> Wake woman!&mdash;not a bit of woman&rsquo;s wakeness in ye. Oh,
      my cat-o&rsquo;-cats! let any man throw her from him, which way he will, she&rsquo;s
      on her legs and at him again, tooth and claw.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> With nine lives, renewable for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>Exit CATTY.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>O&rsquo;Bla.</i> (<i>alone</i>) There&rsquo;s a demon in woman&rsquo;s form set to work
      for me! Oh, this works well&mdash;and no fear that the Roonies and
      McBrides should ever come to an understanding to cut me out. Young Mr.
      Randal Rooney, my humble compliments to you, and I hope you&rsquo;ll become the
      willow which you&rsquo;ll soon have to wear for Miss Honor McBride&rsquo;s pretty
      sake. But I wonder the brother a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t come up yet with the rist of her
      fortune. (Calls behind the scenes.) Mick! Jack! Jenny! Where&rsquo;s Pat?&mdash;Then
      why don&rsquo;t you know? run down a piece of the road towards Ballynascraw, see
      would you see any body coming, and bring me word would you see Phil
      McBride&mdash;you know, flourishing Phil.&mdash;Now I&rsquo;m prepared every way
      for the shupervishor, only I wish to have something genteel in my fist for
      him, and a show of cash flying about&mdash;nothing like it, to dazzle the
      eyes.

      this fair-time in my barony, these symptoms of a riot, gentlemen, and
      features of a tumult.

      <i>Catty.</i> True, your honour, see&mdash;scarce a symptom of a fature
      lift in the face here of little Charley of Killaspugbrone, with the
      b&rsquo;ating he got from them McBrides, who bred the riot, entirely under
      Flourishing Phil, plase your honour.

    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> <i>Gentleman!</i> what sort? Is it because of the new topped
      boots, or by virtue of the silver-topped whip, and the bit of a red rag
      tied about the throat?&mdash;Then a gentleman&rsquo;s asy made, now-a-days.

      Rooney&mdash;don&rsquo;t you hear <i>silence</i>?&mdash;don&rsquo;t be brawling before
      his honour. Go back wid yourself to your pillar, or post, and fould your

      more honourable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Irrelevant in toto, madam; for buckeens and spalpeens are
      manners or species of men unknown to or not cognizable by the eye of the
      law; against them, therefore, you cannot swear: but if you have any thing
      against Philip McBride&mdash;

    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Oh, I have plinty, and will swear, plase your honour, that

      there can be no <i>thumb kissing</i> with me, gentlemen.

      <i>Phil.</i> I&rsquo;ve no defence to make, plase your honour, but that I&rsquo;m
      innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> (<i>shaking his head</i>) The worst defence in law, my
      good friend, unless you&rsquo;ve witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> All present that time in the fair was too busy fighting for
      themselves to witness for me that I was not; except I&rsquo;d call upon one that
      would clear me entirely, which is that there young man on the opposite
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Oh, the impudent fellow! Is it my son?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Is it Randal Rooney? Why, Phil, are you turned <i>innocent</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> I am not, father, at all. But with your lave, I call on
      Randal Rooney, for he is an undeniable honourable man&mdash;I refer all to
      his evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> Thank you, Phil. I&rsquo;ll witness the truth, on whatever side.

      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Silence, and let <i>me</i> be heard. Leave this lady to
      me; I know how to manage these feminine vixens. Mrs. Catherine Rooney,
      listen to me&mdash;you are a reasonable woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> I am not, nor don&rsquo;t pretend to it, plase your honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> But you can hear reason, madam, I presume, from the voice
      of authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> No, plase your honour&mdash;I&rsquo;m deaf, stone deaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> No trifling with me, madam; give me leave to advise you a
      little for your good.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Plase your honour, it&rsquo;s of no use&mdash;from a child up I
      never could stand to be advised for my good. See, I&rsquo;d get hot and hotter,
      plase your honour, till I&rsquo;d bounce! I&rsquo;d fly! I&rsquo;d burst! and myself does
      not know what mischief I mightn&rsquo;t do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Constable! take charge of this cursing and cursed woman,
      who has not respect for man or magistrate. Away with her out of my
      presence!&mdash;I commit her for a contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal</i> (<i>eagerly</i>) Oh! plase your honour, I beg your honour&rsquo;s
      pardon for her&mdash;my mother&mdash;entirely. When she is in her rason,
      she has the greatest respect for the whole bench, and your honour above
      all. Oh! your honour, be plasing this once! Excuse her, and I&rsquo;ll go bail
      for her she won&rsquo;t say another word till she&rsquo;d get the nod from your
      honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> On that condition, and on that condition only, I am
      willing to pass over the past. Fall back, constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> (<i>aside</i>) Why then, Gerald O&rsquo;Blaney mislet me. This
      Carver is a <i>fauterer</i> of the Scotch. Bad luck to every bone in his
      body! (<i>As CATTY says this her son draws her back, and tries to pacify
      her.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Is she muttering, constable?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> Not a word, plase your honour, only just telling herself to
      be quiet. Oh, mother, dearest, I&rsquo;ll kneel to plase you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Kneel! oh, to an ould woman like me&mdash;no standing that!
      So here, on my hunkers I am, for your sake, Randal, and not a word, good
      or bad! Can woman do more? (<i>She sits with her fingers on her lips.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Now for your defence, Philip: be short, for mercy&rsquo;s sake!
      (<i>pulling out his watch.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> Not to be detaining your honour too long&mdash;I was in
      Ballynavogue this forenoon, and was just&mdash;that is, Miss Car&rsquo;line
      Flaherty was just&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Miss Caroline Flaherty! What in nature can she have to do
      with the business?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> Only axing me, sir, she was, to play the flageolets, which
      was the rason I was sitting at Flaherty&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Address yourself to the court, young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> Sitting at Flaherty&rsquo;s&mdash;in the parlour, with the door
      open, and all the McBrides which was <i>in it</i> was in the outer room
      taking a toombler o&rsquo; punch I trated &lsquo;em to&mdash;but not drinking&mdash;not
      a man <i>out o&rsquo; the way</i>&mdash;when in comes that gentlewoman. (<i>Pointing
      to Mrs. ROONEY.&mdash;RANDAL groans.</i>) Never fear, Randal, I&rsquo;ll tell it
      as soft as I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Soft, why? Mighty soft cratur ever since he was born,
      plase your honour, though he&rsquo;s my son.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> (<i>putting his fingers on his lips</i>) Friend Matthew,
      no reflections in a court of justice ever. Go on, Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> So some one having tould Mrs. Rooney lies, as I&rsquo;m confident,
      sir&mdash;for she come in quite <i>mad</i>, and abused my sister Honor;
      accusing her, before all, of being sitting and giving her company to
      Randal Rooney at Flaherty&rsquo;s, drinking, and something about a ring, and a
      meeting behind the chapel, which I couldn&rsquo;t understand;&mdash;but it fired
      me, and I stepped&mdash;but I recollected I&rsquo;d promised Honor not to let
      her provoke me to lift a hand good or bad&mdash;so I stepped across very
      civil, and I said to her, says I, Ma&rsquo;am, it&rsquo;s all lies&mdash;some one has
      been belying Honor McBride to you, Mrs. Rooney.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>CATTY sighs and groans, striking the back of one hand reiteratedly
      into the palm of the other&mdash;rises&mdash;beats the devil&rsquo;s tattoo as
      she stands&mdash;then claps her hands again.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> That woman has certainly more ways of making a noise,
      without speaking, than any woman upon earth. Proceed, Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> Depind on it, it&rsquo;s all lies, Mrs. Rooney, says I, ma&rsquo;am. No,
      but <i>you</i> lie, flourishing Phil, says she. With that every McBride to
      a man, rises from the table, catching up chairs and stools and toomblers
      and jugs to revenge Honor and me. Not for your life, boys, don&rsquo;t <i>let-drive</i>
      ne&rsquo;er a one of yees, says I&mdash;she&rsquo;s a woman, and a widow woman, and
      only a <i>scould</i> from her birth: so they held their hands; but she
      giving tongue bitter, &lsquo;twas hard for flesh and blood to stand it. Now, for
      the love of heaven and me, sit down all, and be <i>quite</i> as lambs, and
      finish your poonch like gentlemen, sir, says I: so saying, I <i>tuk</i>
      Mrs. Rooney up in my arms tenderly, as I would a bould child&mdash;she
      screeching and screeching like mad:&mdash;whereupon her jock caught on the
      chair, pocket-hole or something, and give one rent from head to <i>fut</i>&mdash;and
      that was the tattering of the jock. So we got her to the door, and there
      she spying her son by ill-luck in the street, directly stretches out her&rsquo; 
      arms, and kicking my shins, plase your honour, till I could not hold her,
      &ldquo;Murder! Randal Rooney,&rdquo; cries she, &ldquo;and will you see your own mother
      murdered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> Them were the very words, I acknowledge, she used, which
      put me past my rason, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> Then Randal Rooney, being past his rason, turns to all them
      Roonies that were <i>in no condition.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> That were, what we in English would call <i>drunk</i>, I
      presume?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> Something very near it, plase your honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phil.</i> Sitting on the bench outside the door they were, when Randal
      came up. &ldquo;Up, Roonies, and at &lsquo;em!&rdquo; cried he; and up, to be sure, they
      flew, shillelahs and all, like lightning, daling blows on all of us
      McBrides: but I never lifted a hand; and Randal, I&rsquo;ll do him justice,
      avoided to lift a hand against me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> And while I live I&rsquo;ll never forget <i>that</i> hour, nor <i>this</i>
      hour, Phil, and all your generous construction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> (<i>aside</i>) Why then it almost softens me; but I won&rsquo;t be
      made a fool on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> (<i>who has been re-considering the examinations</i>) It
      appears to me that you, Mr. Philip McBride, did, as the law allows, only
      <i>lay hands softly</i> upon complainant, Catherine Rooney; and the
      Rooneys, as it appears, struck, and did strike, the first blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> I can&rsquo;t deny, plase your honour, we did.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> (<i>tearing the examinations</i>) Then, gentlemen&mdash;you
      Roonies&mdash;<i>beaten men</i>, I cannot possibly take your examinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>When the examinations are torn, the McBRIDES all bow and thank his
      honour.</i>

    </p>

      Mr. CARVER.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> If your honour would be plasing to let her spake now, or
      she&rsquo;d burst, may be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Speak now, woman, and ever after hold your tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Then I am rasonable now, plase your honour; for I&rsquo;ll put it
      to the test&mdash;see, I&rsquo;ll withdraw my examinations entirely, and I&rsquo;ll
      recant&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll go farther, I&rsquo;ll own I&rsquo;m wrong&mdash;(though I know
      I&rsquo;m right)&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll beg your pardon, McBrides, if&mdash;(but I know
      I&rsquo;ll not have to beg your pardon either)&mdash;but I say I <i>will</i> beg
      your pardon, McBrides, <i>if</i>, mind <i>if</i>, you will accept my test,
      and it fails me.

      <i>Randal.</i> Dear mother, name your test.

      no ring, and was not behind the chapel with Randal, nor drinking at
      Flaherty&rsquo;s with him, the time she was, I give up all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> Agreed, with all the pleasure in life, mother. Oh, may I

      Mr. Randal Rooney&mdash;answer, sir, to this matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> I don&rsquo;t deny it, sir&mdash;I bet him, &lsquo;tis true.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> To a jelly&mdash;without marcy&mdash;he did, plase your
      honour, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> Sir, plase your honour, I got rason to suspect this man to
      be the author of all them lies that was tould backwards and forwards to my
      mother, about me and Miss Honor McBride, which made my mother mad, and
      driv&rsquo; her to raise the riot, plase your honour. I charged Pat with the
      lies, and he shirked, and could give me no satisfaction, but kept swearing
      he was no liar, and bid me keep my distance, for he&rsquo;d a pocket pistol
      about him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you have about you&mdash;you have not the
      truth about ye, nor in ye,&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;ye are a liar, Pat Coxe,&rdquo; says I: so
      he cocked the pistol at me, saying, <i>that</i> would prove me a coward&mdash;with
      that I wrenched the pistol from him, and <i>bet</i> him in a big passion.
      I own to that, plase your honour&mdash;there I own I was wrong (<i>turning
      to HONOR</i>), to demane myself lifting my hand any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> But it is not yet proved that this man has told any lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> If he has tould no lies, I wronged him. Speak, mother&mdash;(<i>COXE
      gets behind CATTY, and twitches her gown</i>), was it he who was the
      informer, or not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> Nay, Pat Coxe, if you lied, I&rsquo;ll not screen you; but if you
      tould the truth, stand out like a man, and stand to it, and I&rsquo;ll stand by
      you, against my own son even, Randal, if he was the author of the report.
      In plain words, then, he, Pat Coxe, tould me, that she, Honor McBride,
      gave you, Randal Rooney, the meeting behind the chapel, and you gave her
      the ring&mdash;and then she went with you to drink at Flaherty&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> (<i>starting up</i>) Oh! who <i>could</i> say the like of
      me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Catty.</i> There he stands&mdash;now, Pat, you must stand or fall&mdash;will
      you swear to what you said? (<i>Old McBRIDE and PHIL approach PAT.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> This is not the point before me; but, however, I waive
      that objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> Oh! mother, don&rsquo;t put him to his oath, lest he&rsquo;d perjure
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> I&rsquo;ll swear: do you think I&rsquo;d be making a liar of myself?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Father&mdash;Phil dear&mdash;hear me one word!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randal.</i> Hear her&mdash;oh! hear her&mdash;go to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> (<i>in a low voice</i>) Would you ask at what time it was he
      pretends I was taking the ring and all that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old McB.</i> Plase your honour, would you ask the rascal what time?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Don&rsquo;t call him rascal, sir&mdash;no <i>rascals</i> in my
      presence. What time did you see Honor McBride behind the chapel, Pat Coxe?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> As the clock struck twelve&mdash;I mind&mdash;by the same
      token the workmen&rsquo;s bell rang as usual! that same time, just as I seen Mr.
      Randal there putting the ring on her finger, and I said, &ldquo;<i>There&rsquo;s the
      bell ringing for a wedding</i>,&rdquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> To whom did you say that, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat.</i> To myself, plase your honour&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> Truth! That time the clock struck twelve and the bell rang,
      I was happily here in this house, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> If I might take the liberty to call one could do me justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> No liberty in justice&mdash;speak out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Honor.</i> If I might trouble Mrs. Carver herself?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Carv.</i> Mrs. Carver will think it no trouble (<i>rising with
      dignity</i>) to do justice, for she has been the wife to one of his
      majesty&rsquo;s justices of the peace for many years.

      putting a ring on her finger, when the clock struck twelve, and our
      workmen&rsquo;s bell rang this morning. Honor avers she was at Bob&rsquo;s Fort with
      you: now as she could not be, like a bird, in two places at once&mdash;was
      she with you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Carv.</i> Honor McBride was with me when the workmen&rsquo;s bell rang,
      and when the clock struck twelve, this day&mdash;she stayed with me till

      has this day given me such proofs of her being a good girl, a good

      wishes for life.

      SCENE I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>A Dressing-Room in Bannow-Castle, in Ireland.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter Sir WILLIAM HAMDEN, in his morning-gown.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Every thing precisely in order, even in Ireland!&mdash;laid,
      I do believe, at the very same angle at which they used to be placed on my
      own dressing-table, at Hamden-place, in Kent. Exact Gilbert! most punctual
      of valet de chambres!&mdash;and a young fellow, as he is, too! It is
      admirable!&mdash;Ay, though he looks as if he were made of wood, and moves
      like an automaton, he has a warm heart, and a true English spirit&mdash;true-born
      English every inch of him. I remember him, when first I saw him ten years
      ago at his father&rsquo;s, Farmer Ashfield&rsquo;s, at the harvest-home; there was
      Gilbert in all his glory, seated on the top of a hay-rick, singing,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Then sing in praise of men of Kent,
    So loyal, brave, and free;
  Of Britain&rsquo;s race, if one surpass,
    A man of Kent is he!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      How he brought himself to quit the men of Kent to come to Ireland with me
      is wonderful. However, now he is here, I hope he is tolerably happy: I
      must ask the question in direct terms; for Gilbert would never speak till
      spoken to, let him feel what he might.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> (<i>calls</i>) Gilbert!&mdash;Gilbert!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter GILBERT.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> Here, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Gilbert, now you have been in Ireland some weeks, I hope you
      are not unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> No, sir, thank you, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> But are you happy, man?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> Yes, sir, thank you, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>GILBERT retires, and seems busy arranging his master&rsquo;s clothes: Sir
      WILLIAM continues dressing.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> (<i>aside</i>) <i>Yes, sir, thank you, sir.</i> As dry as a
      chip&mdash;sparing of his words, as if they were his last. And the fellow
      can talk if he would&mdash;has humour, too, if one could get it out; and
      eloquence, could I but touch the right string, the heartstring. I&rsquo;ll try
      again. (<i>Aloud</i>) Gilbert!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> Yes, sir. (<i>Comes forward respectfully.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Pray what regiment was it that was passing yesterday through
      the village of Bannow?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> I do not know, indeed, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> That is to say, you saw they were Highlanders, and that was
      enough for you&mdash;you are not fond of the Scotch, Gilbert?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> No, sir, I can&rsquo;t say as I be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> But, Gilbert, for my sake you must conquer this prejudice. I
      have many Scotch friends whom I shall go to visit one of these days&mdash;excellent
      friends they are!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> Are they, sir? If so be you found them so, I will do my best,
      I&rsquo;m sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Then pray go down to the inn here, and inquire if any of the
      Scotch officers are there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> I will, sir. I heard say the officers went off this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Then you need not go to inquire for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> No, sir. Only as I heard say, the drum-major and band is to
      stay a few days in Bannow, on account of their wanting to enlist a new
      bugle-boy. I was a thinking, if so be, sir, you thought well of it, on
      account you like these Scotch, I&rsquo;d better to step down, and see how the
      men be as to being comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> That&rsquo;s right, do. Pray, have they tolerable accommodations
      at the inn in this village?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> (<i>smiling</i>) I can&rsquo;t say much for that, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> (<i>aside</i>) Now I shall set him going. (<i>Aloud</i>)
      What, the inn here is not like one of our English inns on the Bath road?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> (<i>suppressing a laugh</i>) Bath road! Bless you, sir, it&rsquo;s
      no more like an inn on the Bath road, nor on any road, cross or by-road
      whatsomdever, as ever I seed in England. No more like&mdash;no more like
      than nothing at all, sir!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> What sort of a place is it, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> Why, sir, I&rsquo;d be ashamed almost to tell you. Why, sir, I
      never seed such a place to call an inn, in all my born days afore. First
      and foremost, sir, there&rsquo;s the pig is in and out of the kitchen all day
      long, and next the calf has what they call the run of the kitchen; so what
      with them brute beasts, and the poultry that has no coop, and is always
      under one&rsquo;s feet, or over one&rsquo;s head, the kitchen is no place for a
      Christian, even to eat his bread and cheese in.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Well, so much for the kitchen. But the parlour&mdash;they
      have a parlour, I suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> Yes, sir, they have a parlour as they may call it, if they
      think proper, sir. But then again, an honest English farmer would be <i>afeard
      on</i> his life to stay in it, on account of the ceiling just a coming
      down a&rsquo; top of his head. And if he should go up stairs, sir, why that&rsquo;s as
      bad again, and worse; for the half of them there stairs is rotten, and
      ever so many pulled down and burnt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Burnt!&mdash;the stairs?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> Burnt, sir, as sure as I&rsquo;m standing here!&mdash;burnt, sir,
      for fuel one <i>scarce year</i>, as they says, sir. Moreover, when a man
      does get up the stairs, sir, why he is as bad off again, and worse; for
      the floor of the place they calls the bedchamber, shakes at every step, as
      if it was a coming down with one; and the walls has all cracks, from top
      to toe&mdash;and there&rsquo;s rat-holes, or holes o&rsquo; some sort or t&rsquo;other, all
      in the floor: so that if a man don&rsquo;t pick his steps curiously, his leg
      must go down through the ceiling below. And moreover, there&rsquo;s holes over
      head through the roof, sir; so that if it rains, it can&rsquo;t but pour on the
      bed. They tell me, they used for to shift the bed from one place to
      another, to find, as they say, the dry corner; but now the floor is grown
      so crazy, they dare not stir the bed for their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Worse and worse!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> And moreover, they have it now in the worst place in the
      whole room, sir. Close at the head of the bed, there is a window with
      every pane broke, and some out entirely, and the women&rsquo;s petticoats and
      the men&rsquo;s hats just stuck in to <i>stop all for the night</i>, as they
      say, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>GILBERT tries to stifle his laughter.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Laugh out, honest Gilbert. In spite of your gravity and your
      civility, laugh. There is no harm, but sometimes a great deal of good done
      by laughing, especially in Ireland. Laughing has mended, or caused to be
      mended, many things that never would have been mended otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> (<i>recovering his gravity</i>) That&rsquo;s true, I dare to say,
      sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Now, Gilbert, if you were to keep an inn, it would be a very
      different sort of inn from what you have been describing&mdash;would not
      it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> I hope so, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> I remember when we were talking of establishing you in
      England, that your father told me you would like to set up an inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> (<i>his face brightening</i>) For sartin, sir, &lsquo;tis the thing
      in the whole world I should like the best, and be the proudest on, if so
      be it was in my power, and if so be, sir, you could spare me. (<i>Holding
      his master&rsquo;s coat for him to put on.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> <i>Could.</i> spare you, Gilbert!&mdash;I <i>will</i> spare
      you, whether I can conveniently or not. If I had an opportunity of
      establishing advantageously a man who has served me faithfully for ten
      years, do you think I would not put myself to a little inconvenience to do
      it?&mdash;Gilbert, you do not know Sir William Hamden.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> Thank you, sir, but I do&mdash;and I should be main sorry to
      leave you, that&rsquo;s sartin, if it was even to be landlord of the best inn in
      all England&mdash;I know I should.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> I believe it.&mdash;But, stay&mdash;let us understand one
      another&mdash;I am not talking of England, and perhaps you are not
      thinking of Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> Yes, sir, but I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> You are! I am heartily glad to hear it, for then I can serve
      you directly. This young heiress, my niece, to whom this town belongs, has
      a new inn ready built.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> I know, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Then, Gilbert, write a proposal for this inn, if you wish
      for it, and I will speak to my niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> (<i>bowing</i>) I thank you, sir&mdash;only I hope I shall
      not stand in any honest man&rsquo;s light. As to a dishonest man, I can&rsquo;t say I
      value standing in his light, being that he has no right to have any, as I
      can see.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> So, Gilbert, you will settle in Ireland at last? I am
      heartily glad to see you have overcome your prejudices against this
      country. How has this been brought about?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> Why, sir, the thing was, I didn&rsquo;t know nothing about it, and
      there was a many lies told backwards and forwards of Ireland, by a many
      that ought to have known better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> And now that you have seen with your own eyes, you are
      happily convinced that in Ireland the men are not all savages.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> No, sir, no ways savage, except in the article of some of
      them going bare-footed; but the men is good men, most of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> And the women? You find that they have not wings on their
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> No, sir. (<i>Smiling</i>) And I&rsquo;m glad they have not got
      wings, else they might fly away from us, which I&rsquo;d be sorry for&mdash;some
      of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>After making this speech, GILBERT steps back, and brushes his master&rsquo;s
      hat diligently.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> (<i>aside</i>) Ha! is that the case? Now I understand it
      all. &lsquo;Tis fair, that Cupid, who blinds so many, should open the eyes of
      some of his votaries. (<i>Aloud.</i>) When you set up as landlord in your
      new inn, Gilbert, (<i>Gilbert comes forward</i>) you will want a landlady,
      shall not you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> (<i>falls back, and answers</i>) I shall, sir, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Miss&mdash;what&rsquo;s her name? the daughter of the landlord of
      the present inn. Miss&mdash;what&rsquo;s her name?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> (<i>answers without coming forward</i>) Miss Gallagher, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Miss Gallagher?&mdash;A very ugly name!&mdash;I think it
      would be charity to change it, Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> (<i>bashfully</i>) It would, no doubt, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> She is a very pretty girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> She is, sir, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>Cleaning the brush with his hand, bows, and is retiring.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Gilbert, stay, (<i>GILBERT returns.</i>) I say, Gilbert, I
      took particular notice of this Miss Gallagher, as she was speaking to you
      last Sunday. I thought she seemed to smile upon you, Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> (<i>very bashfully</i>) I can&rsquo;t say, indeed, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> I don&rsquo;t mean, my good Gilbert, to press you to say any thing
      that you don&rsquo;t choose to say. It was not from idle curiosity that I asked
      any questions, but from a sincere desire to serve you in whatever way you
      like best, Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> Oh, dear master! I can&rsquo;t speak, you are so good to me, and
      always was&mdash;too good!&mdash;so I say nothing. Only I&rsquo;m not ungrateful&mdash;I
      know I&rsquo;m not ungrateful, that I am not! And as to the rest, there&rsquo;s not a
      thought I have, you&rsquo;d condescend for to know, but you should know it as
      soon as my mother&mdash;that&rsquo;s to say, as soon as ever I knowed it myself.
      But, sir, the thing is this, since you&rsquo;re so good to let me speak to you,
      sir&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Speak on, pray, my good fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> Then, sir, the thing is this. There&rsquo;s one girl, they say, has
      set her thoughts upon me: now I don&rsquo;t like she, because why? I loves
      another; but I should not choose to say so, on account of its not being
      over and above civil, and on account of my not knowing yet for sartin
      whether or not the girl I loves loves me, being I never yet could bring
      myself to ask her the question. I&rsquo;d rather not mention her name neither,
      till I be more at a sartinty. But since you be so kind, sir, if you be so
      good to give me till this evening, sir, as I have now, with the hopes of
      the new inn, an independency to offer her, I will take courage, and I
      shall have her answer soon, sir&mdash;and I will let you know with many
      thanks, sir, whether&mdash;whether my heart&rsquo;s broke or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>Exit GILBERT hastily.</i>

    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> (<i>alone</i>) Good, affectionate creature! But who would

      {<i>Sound of a drum at a distance&mdash;Miss GALLAGHER starts up and
      listens.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> Hark till I hear! Is not that a drum I hear? Ay, I had
      always a quick ear for the drum from my cradle. And there&rsquo;s the whole band&mdash;but
      it&rsquo;s only at the turn of the avenue. It&rsquo;s on parade they are. So I&rsquo;ll be
      dressed and dacent before they are here, I&rsquo;ll engage. And it&rsquo;s my plaid
      scarf I&rsquo;ll throw over all, iligant for the Highlanders, and I don&rsquo;t doubt
      but the drum-major will be conquist to it at my feet afore night&mdash;and
      what will Mr. Gilbert say to that? And what matter what he says?&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      not bound to him, especially as he never popped me the question, being so
      preposterously bashful, as them Englishmen have the misfortune to be. But
      that&rsquo;s not my fault any way. And if I happen to find a more shutable
      match, while he&rsquo;s turning the words in his mouth, who&rsquo;s to blame me?&mdash;My
      father, suppose!&mdash;And what matter?&mdash;Have not I two hundred
      pounds of my own, down on the nail, if the worst come to the worst, and
      why need I be a slave to any man, father or other?&mdash;But he&rsquo;ll kill
      himself soon with the whiskey, poor man, at the rate he&rsquo;s going. Two
      glasses now for his <i>mornings</i>, and his <i>mornings</i> are going on
      all day. There he is, roaring. (<i>Mr. GALLAGHER heard singing.</i>) You
      can&rsquo;t come in here, sir.

      <i>Enter CHRISTY GALLAGHER, kicking the door open.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Can&rsquo;t I, dear? what will hinder me?&mdash;Give me the <i>kay</i>
      of the spirits, if you plase.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> Oh, sir! see how you are walking through all my things.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> And they on the floor!&mdash;where else should I walk, but
      on the floor, pray, Miss Gallagher?&mdash;Is it, like a fly, on the
      ceiling you&rsquo;d have me be, walking with my head upside down, to plase you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> Indeed, sir, whatever way you&rsquo;re walking, it&rsquo;s with your
      head upside down, as any body may notice, and that don&rsquo;t plase me at all&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      it a shame, in a morning?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Phoo! don&rsquo;t be talking of shame, you that knows nothing
      about it. But lend me the kay of the spirits, Florry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> Sir, my name&rsquo;s Florinda&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve not the kay of the
      spirits at all, nor any such vulgar thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Vulgar! is it the kay?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> Yes, sir, it&rsquo;s very vulgar to be keeping of kays.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> That&rsquo;s lucky, for I&rsquo;ve lost all mine now. Every single kay
      I have in the wide world now I lost, barring this kay of the spirits, and
      that must be gone after the rest too I b&rsquo;lieve, since you know nothing of
      it, unless it be in this here chist.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>CHRISTY goes to the chest.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> Oh, mercy, sir!&mdash;Take care of the looking-glass, which
      is broke already. Oh, then, father, &lsquo;tis not in the chist, &lsquo;pon my word
      and honour now, if you&rsquo;ll b&rsquo;lieve: so don&rsquo;t be rummaging of all my things.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>CHRISTY persists in opening the chest.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> It don&rsquo;t signify, Florry; I&rsquo;ve granted myself a gineral
      sarch-warrant; dear, for the kay; and, by the blessing, I&rsquo;ll go clane to
      the bottom o&rsquo; this chist. (<i>Miss GALLAGHER writhes in agony.</i>) Why,
      what makes you stand twisting there like an eel or an ape, child?&mdash;What,
      in the name of the ould one, is it you&rsquo;re afeard on?&mdash;Was the chist
      full now of love-letter scrawls from the grand signior or the pope
      himself, you could not be more tinder of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> Tinder, sir!&mdash;to be sure, when it&rsquo;s my best bonnet I&rsquo;m
      thinking on, which you are mashing entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Never fear, dear! I won&rsquo;t mash an atom of the bonnet,
      provided always, you&rsquo;ll mash these apples for me, jewel. (<i>He takes
      apples out of the chest.</i>) And wasn&rsquo;t I lucky to find them in it? Oh, I
      knew I&rsquo;d not sarch this chist for nothing. See how they&rsquo;ll make an iligant
      apple-pie for Mr. Gilbert now, who loves an iligant apple-pie above all
      things&mdash;your iligant self always excipted, dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>Miss GALLAGHER makes a slight curtsy, but motions the apples from her.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> Give the apples then to the girl, sir, and she&rsquo;ll make you
      the pie, for I suppose she knows how.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> And don&rsquo;t you, then, Florry?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> And how should I, sir?&mdash;You didn&rsquo;t send me to the
      dancing-school of Ferrinafad to larn me to make apple-pies, I conclude.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Troth, Florry, &lsquo;twas not I sint you there, sorrow foot but
      your mother; only she&rsquo;s in her grave, and it&rsquo;s bad to be talking ill of
      the dead any way. But be that how it will, Mr. Gilbert must get the
      apple-pie, for rasons of my own that need not be mintioned. So, Biddy!
      Biddy, girl! Biddy Doyle!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter BIDDY, running, with a ladle in her hand.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Drop whatever you have in your hand, and come here, and be
      hanged to you! And had you no ears to your head, Biddy?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> Sure I have, sir&mdash;ears enough. Only they are bothering
      me so without, that pig and the dog fighting, that I could not hear ye
      calling at-all-at-all. What is it?&mdash;For I&rsquo;m skimming the pot, and
      can&rsquo;t lave it.

    <p>
      {<i>Miss GALLAGHER goes on dressing</i>
    </p>

      apple-pie, Biddy, smart.

    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> Save us, sir!&mdash;And how will I ever get time, when I&rsquo;ve
      the hash to make for them Scotch yet? Nor can I tell, for the life of me,
      what it was I did with the onions and scallions neither, barring by great
      luck they&rsquo;d be in and under the press here&mdash;(<i>running to look under

      {<i>BIDDY throws the onions out from under the press, while he speaks.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> Then she&rsquo;s as idle a girl as treads the earth, in or out of
      shoe-leather, for there&rsquo;s my bed that she has not made yet, and the stairs
      with a month&rsquo;s dust always; and never ready by any chance to do a pin&rsquo;s
      worth for one, when one&rsquo;s dressing.

    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> And my plain hanke&rsquo;cher that must be had, and where will I
      find it, in the name of all the damons, in this chaos you&rsquo;ve made me out

      draws it out from the heap under her father&rsquo;s arm, and smooths it on her
      knee.</i>) But, oh! father, how you are making hay of my things!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Then I wish I could make hay of them, for hay is much
      wanting for the horses that&rsquo;s in it.

      the street&mdash;Oh, sir, if you plase, in the name of mercy!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> (<i>jumping out</i>) Why, then, sittle it all yourself,
      Biddy, and success to you; but you&rsquo;ll no more get all in again afore
      Christmas, to the best of my opinion, no more, see! than you&rsquo;d get bottled
      porter, froth and all, into the bottle again, once it was out.

      <i>Miss G.</i> Such comparisons!&mdash;(<i>tossing back her head.</i>)
    </p>

      <i>Christy.</i> And caparisons!&mdash;(<i>pointing to the finery on the

      answer for the master-kay, sure!&mdash;that poker that is houlding up the

      <i>Biddy.</i> &lsquo;Twas only axing me, they were, could they all get beds the
      night in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Beds! ay can yees, and for a dozen more&mdash;only the
      room above is tinder in the joists, and I would not choose to put more on
      the floor than two beds, and one shake-down, which will answer for five;
      for it&rsquo;s a folly to talk,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you the truth, and not a word of
      lie. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be idle to put more of yees in the room than it could
      hold, and to have the floor be coming through the parlour ceiling, and so
      spoil two good rooms for one night&rsquo;s bad rest, jantlemen?&mdash;Well,
      Biddy, what is it they&rsquo;re saying?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> They say they don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;can they have beds or
      not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Why, body and bones! No, then, since nothing else will
      they comprehend,&mdash;<i>no</i>,&mdash;only five, say,&mdash;five can
      sleep in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>The band divide into two parties,&mdash;Five remain, and the others
      walk off in silence.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> And it&rsquo;s into the room you&rsquo;d best walk up, had not yees,
      five jantlemen, that sleep?
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>The five walk into the parlour&mdash;CHRISTY preparing to follow,
      carrying whiskey bottle and, jug&mdash;turns back, and says to BIDDY,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it dumb they are all? or <i>innocents</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> Not at all innocents, no more than myself nor yourself. Nor
      dumb neither, only that the Scotch tongue can&rsquo;t spake English as we do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Oh! if that&rsquo;s all, after dinner the whiskey punch will
      make &lsquo;em spake, I&rsquo;ll engage.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>Exit CHRISTY.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> &lsquo;Tis I that am glad they&rsquo;ve taken themselves away, for
      there&rsquo;s no cooking with all the men in the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter Mr. ANDREW HOPE, Drum-major.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> A gude day to you, my gude lassy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> The same to you, sir, and kindly. I beg your pardon for not
      knowing&mdash;would it be the drum-major, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> No offence, my gude lass; I am Andrew Hope, and drum-major.
      I met some of my men in the street coming down, and they told me they
      could not have beds here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> No, sir, plase your honour, only five that&rsquo;s in the room
      yonder: if you&rsquo;d be plased to walk up, and you&rsquo;ll get your dinner
      immediately, your honour, as fast as can be dished, your honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> No hurry, my gude lass. But I would willingly see the beds
      for my poor fellows, that has had a sair march.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> Why then, if your honour would take a fool&rsquo;s advice, you&rsquo;d
      not be looking at them beds, to be spoiling your dinner&mdash;since, good
      or bad, all the looking at &lsquo;em in the wide world won&rsquo;t mend &lsquo;em one
      feather, sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> My gude girl, that&rsquo;s true. Still I&rsquo;d like ever to face the
      worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> Then it&rsquo;s up that ladder you&rsquo;ll go.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> No stairs?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> Oh, there are stairs&mdash;but they are burnt and coming
      down, and you&rsquo;ll find the ladder safest and best; only mind the little
      holes in the floor, if you plase, your honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>Mr. HOPE ascends the ladder while she speaks, and goes into the
      bedchamber above.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>BIDDY, sola.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I&rsquo;m ashamed of my life, when a stranger and foreigner&rsquo;s reviewing
      our house, though I&rsquo;m only the girl in it, and no ways answerable. It
      frets me for my country forenent them Scotch and English. (<i>Mr. HOPE
      descends the ladder.</i>) Then I&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s not better for your honour&rsquo;s
      self, and men. But there&rsquo;s a new inn to be opened the 25th, in this town;
      and if you return this way, I hope things will be more agreeable and
      proper. But you&rsquo;ll have no bad dinner, your honour, any way;&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      Scotch broth, and Scotch hash, and fried eggs and bacon, and a turkey, and
      a boiled leg of mutton and turnips, and <i>pratees</i> the best, and well
      boiled; and I hope, your honour, that&rsquo;s enough for a soldier&rsquo;s dinner,
      that&rsquo;s not nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> Enough for a soldier&rsquo;s dinner! ay, gude truth, my lass; and
      more than enough for Andrew Hope, who is no ways nice. But, tell me, have
      you no one to help you here, to dress all this?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> Sorrow one, to do a hand&rsquo;s turn for me but myself, plase
      your honour; for the daughter of the house is too fine to put her hand to
      any thing in life: but she&rsquo;s in the room there within, beyond, if you
      would like to see her&mdash;a fine lady she is!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> A fine lady, is she? Weel, fine or coarse, I shall like to
      see her,&mdash;and weel I may and must, for I had a brother once I luved
      as my life; and four years back that brother fell sick here, on his road
      to the north, and was kindly tended here at the inn at Bannow; and he
      charged me, puir lad, on his death-bed, if ever fate should quarter me in
      Bannow, to inquire for his gude friends at the inn, and to return them his
      thanks; and so I&rsquo;m fain to do, and will not sleep till I&rsquo;ve done so.&mdash;But
      tell me first, my kind lassy,&mdash;for I see you are a kind lassy,&mdash;tell
      me, has not this house had a change of fortune, and fallen to decay of
      late? for the inn at Bannow was pictured to me as a bra&rsquo; neat place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> Ah! that was, may-be, the time the Larkens had it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> The Larkens!&mdash;that was the very name: it warms my heart
      to hear the sound of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> Ay, and quite another sort of an inn this was, I hear talk,
      in their time,&mdash;and quite another guess sort, the Larkens from these
      Gallaghers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> And what has become of the Larkens, I pray?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> They are still living up yonder, by the bush of Bannow, in a
      snug little place of a cabin&mdash;that is, the Widow Kelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> Kelly!&mdash;but I am looking for Larken.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> Oh, Larken! that&rsquo;s Kelly: &lsquo;tis all one&mdash;she was a Kelly
      before she was married, and in this country we stick to the maiden&rsquo;s name
      throughout.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> The same in our country&mdash;often.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> Indeed! and her daughter&rsquo;s name is Mabel, after the Kellys;
      for you might have noticed, if it ever happened your honour to hear it, an
      ould song of Mabel Kelly&mdash;<i>Planxty</i> Kelly. Then the present
      Mabel is as sweet a cratur as ever the ould Mabel Kelly was&mdash;but I
      must mind the pratees. (<i>She goes to lift a pot off the fire.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> Hold! my gude girl, let me do that for you; mine is a strong
      haund.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> I thank your honour,&mdash;it&rsquo;s too much trouble entirely
      for a jantleman like you; but it&rsquo;s always the best jantleman has the <i>laste</i>
      pride.&mdash;Then them Kellys is a good race, ould and young, and I love
      &lsquo;em, root and branch. Besides Mabel the daughter, there&rsquo;s Owen the son,
      and as good a son he is&mdash;no better! He got an edication in the
      beginning, till the troubles came across his family, and the boy, the
      child, for it&rsquo;s bare fifteen he is this minute, give up all his hopes and
      prospects, the cratur! to come home and slave for his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> Ah, that&rsquo;s weel&mdash;that&rsquo;s weel! I luve the lad that makes
      a gude son.&mdash;And is the father <i>deed</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> Ay, dead and deceased he is, long since, and was buried just
      upon that time that ould Sir Cormac, father of the young heiress that is
      now at the castle above, the former landlord that was over us, died, see!&mdash;Then
      there was new times and new <i>takes</i>, and the widow was turned out of
      the inn, and these Gallaghers got it, and all wint wrong and to rack; for
      Mrs. Gallagher, that was, drank herself into her grave unknownst, for it
      was by herself in private she took it; and Christy Gallagher, the present
      man, is doing the same, only publicly, and running through all, and the
      house is tumbling over our ears: but he hopes to get the new inn; and if
      he does, why, he&rsquo;ll be lucky&mdash;and that&rsquo;s all I know, for the dinner
      is done now, and I&rsquo;m going in with it&mdash;and won&rsquo;t your honour walk up
      to the room now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> (<i>going to the ladder</i>) Up here?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> Oh, it&rsquo;s not <i>up</i> at all, your honour, sure! but down
      here&mdash;through this ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> One word more, my gude lassy. As soon as we shall have all
      dined, and you shall have ta&rsquo;en your ane dinner, I shall beg of you, if
      you be not then too much tired, to show me the way to that bush of Bannow,
      whereat this Widow Larken&rsquo;s cottage is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> With all the pleasure in life, if I had not a fut to stand
      upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>Exit Mr. HOPE.&mdash;BIDDY follows with a dish smoking hot.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> And I hope you&rsquo;ll find it an iligant Scotch hash, and
      there&rsquo;s innions plinty&mdash;sure the best I had I&rsquo;d give you; for I&rsquo;m
      confident now he&rsquo;s the true thing&mdash;and tho&rsquo; he is Scotch, he desarves
      to be Irish, every inch of him.

    <p>
      <i>An Irish Cabin.&mdash;The Kitchen.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Widow LARKEN. On one side of her, MABEL at needle-work; on the other
      side, OWEN her son enters, bringing in a spinning-wheel, which he places
      before his mother.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> There, mother, is your wheel mended for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> Oh, as good as new, Owen has made it for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Widow.</i> Well, whatever troubles come upon me in this world, have not
      I a right to be thankful, that has such good childer left me?&mdash;Still
      it grieves me, and goes to the quick of my heart, Mabel, dear, that your
      brother here should be slaving for me, a boy that is qualified for better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> And what better can I be than working for my mother&mdash;man
      or boy?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> And if he thinks it no slavery, what slavery is it, mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Mother, to-day is the day to propose for the new inn&mdash;I
      saw several with the schoolmaster, who was as busy as a bee, penning
      proposals for them, according as they dictated, and framing letters and
      petitions for Sir William Hamden and Miss O&rsquo;Hara. Will you go up to the
      castle and speak, mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Widow.</i> No, no&mdash;I can&rsquo;t speak, Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Here&rsquo;s the pen and ink-horn, and I&rsquo;ll sit me down, if you&rsquo;d
      sooner write than speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Widow.</i> See, Owen, to settle your mind, I would not wish to get that
      inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Not wish to get it! The new inn, mother&mdash;but if you had
      gone over it, as I have. &lsquo;Tis the very thing for you. Neat and compact as
      a nutshell; not one of them grand inns, too great for the place, that never
      answers no more than the hat that&rsquo;s too big for the head, and that always
      blows off.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Widow.</i> No, dear, not the thing for me, now a widow, and your sister
      Mabel&mdash;tho&rsquo; &lsquo;tis not for me to say&mdash;such a likely, fine girl.
      I&rsquo;d not be happy to have her in a public-house&mdash;so many of all sorts
      that would be in it, and drinking, may be, at fairs and funerals, and no
      man of the house, nor master, nor father for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Sure, mother, I&rsquo;m next to a father for her. Amn&rsquo;t I a
      brother? and no brother ever loved a sister better, or was more jealous of
      respect for her; and if you&rsquo;d be pleasing, I could be man and master
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Widow.</i> (<i>laughing</i>) You, ye dear slip of a boy!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> (<i>proudly, and raising his head high</i>) Slip of a boy as
      I am, then, and little as you think of me&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Widow.</i> Oh! I think a great deal of you! only I can&rsquo;t think you big
      nor old, Owen, can I?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> No&mdash;nor any need to be big or old, to keep people of all
      sorts in respect, mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Widow.</i> Then he looked like his father&mdash;did not he, Mabel?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> He did&mdash;God bless him!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Now hear me, mother, for I&rsquo;m going to speak sense. You need
      not listen, Mabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> But it&rsquo;s what I like to listen to sense, especially yours,
      Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Then I can&rsquo;t help it.&mdash;You must hear, even if you blush
      for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> Why would I blush?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Because you won&rsquo;t be able to help it, when I say Mr. Gilbert.&mdash;See!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> Oh, dear Owen! that&rsquo;s not fair. (<i>She falls back a little.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Well, mother, it&rsquo;s with you I&rsquo;m reasoning. If he was your
      son-in-law&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Widow.</i> Hush! that he&rsquo;ll never be. Now, Owen, I&rsquo;ll grow angry if you
      put nonsense in the girl&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> But if it&rsquo;s in the man&rsquo;s head, it&rsquo;s not a bit nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> Owen, you might well say I shouldn&rsquo;t listen to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>Exit MABEL.</i>

    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Widow.</i> May be&mdash;but that <i>may be</i> of yours might lead us
      all wrong.

    <p>
      {<i>She lays her hand on OWEN&rsquo;S arm, and speaks in a serious tone.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Widow.</i> Now, dear, don&rsquo;t be saying one word more to her, lest it
      should end in a disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Still it is my notion, &lsquo;tis Mabel he loves.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Widow.</i> Oh! what should you know, dear, o&rsquo; the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Only having eyes and ears like another.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Widow.</i> Then what hinders him to speak?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> It&rsquo;s bashfulness only, mother. Don&rsquo;t you know what that is?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Widow.</i> I do, dear. It&rsquo;s a woman should know that best. And it is
      not Mabel, nor a daughter of mine, nor a sister of yours, Owen, should be
      more forward to understand than the man is to speak&mdash;was the man a
      prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Mother, you are right; but I&rsquo;m not wrong neither. And since
      I&rsquo;m to say no more, I&rsquo;m gone, mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>Exit OWEN.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Widow.</i> (<i>alone</i>) Now who could blame that boy, whatever he
      does or says? It&rsquo;s all heart he is, and wouldn&rsquo;t hurt a fly, except from
      want of thought. But, stay now, I&rsquo;m thinking of them soldiers that is in
      town. (<i>Sighs</i>) Then I didn&rsquo;t sleep since ever they come; but
      whenever I&rsquo;d be sinking to rest, starting, and fancying I heard the drum
      for Owen to go. (<i>A deep groaning sigh.</i>) Och! and then the
      apparition of Owen in regimentals was afore me!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter OWEN, dancing and singing,</i>
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Success to my brains, and success to my tongue!
  Success to myself, that never was wrong!&rdquo;

    <p>
      <i>Widow.</i> What is it? What ails the boy? Are ye mad, Owen?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> (<i>capering, and snapping his fingers</i>) Ay, mad! mad with
      joy I am. And it&rsquo;s joy I give you, and joy you&rsquo;ll give me, mother darling.
      The new inn&rsquo;s yours, and no other&rsquo;s, and Gilbert is your own too, and no
      other&rsquo;s&mdash;but Mabel&rsquo;s for life. And is not there joy enough for you,
      mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Widow.</i> Joy!&mdash;Oh, too much! (<i>She sinks on a seat.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> I&rsquo;ve been too sudden for her!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Widow.</i> No, dear&mdash;not a bit, only just give me time&mdash;to
      feel it. And is it true? And am I in no dream now? And where&rsquo;s Mabel,
      dear?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Gone to the well, and Gilbert with her. We met her, and he
      turned off with her, and I come on to tell you, mother dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Widow.</i> Make me clear and certain; for I&rsquo;m slow and weak, dear. Who
      told you all this good? and is it true?&mdash;And my child Mabel <i>mavourneen</i>!&mdash;Oh,
      tell me again it&rsquo;s true.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> True as life. But your lips is pale still, and you all in a
      tremble. So lean on me, mother dear, and come out into God&rsquo;s open air,
      till I see your spirit come back&mdash;and here&rsquo;s your bonnet, and we&rsquo;ll
      meet Mabel and Gilbert, and we&rsquo;ll all go up to the castle to give thanks
      to the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Widow.</i> (<i>looking up to heaven</i>) Thanks! Oh, hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I great
      reason to be thankful, if ever widow had!

      <i>An Apartment in Bannote Castle.</i>

    <p>
      <i>Footmen bringing in Baskets of Flowers.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss O&rsquo;HARA and Sir WILLIAM HAMDEN.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> Now, my dear uncle, I want to consult you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> And welcome, my child. But if it is about flowers, you could
      not consult a worse person, for I scarcely know a rose from a &mdash;&mdash;.
      What is this you have here&mdash;a thistle?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> Yes, sir; and that is the very thing I want your opinion
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Well, my dear, all I know about thistles, I think, is, that
      asses love thistles&mdash;will that do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> Oh, no, sir&mdash;pray be serious, for I am in the greatest
      hurry to settle how it is all to be. You know it is St. Patrick&rsquo;s day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Yes, and here is plenty of shamrock, I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> Yes, here is the shamrock&mdash;the rose, the ever blowing
      rose&mdash;and the thistle. And as we are to have Scotch, English, and
      Irish at our little fête champêtre this evening, don&rsquo;t you think it would
      be pretty to have the tents hung with the rose, thistle, and shamrock
      joined?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Very pretty, my dear: and I am glad there are to be tents,
      otherwise a fête champêtre in the month of March would give me the
      rheumatism even to think of.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> Oh, my dear sir, not at all. You will be snug and warm in
      the green-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Well, Clara, dispose of me as you please&mdash;I am entirely
      at your service for the rest of my days.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> Thank you, sir&mdash;you are the best of uncles, guardians,
      and friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>Miss O&rsquo;HARA goes back and appears to be giving directions to the
      servants.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Uncle, nature made me&mdash;guardian, your father made me&mdash;friend,
      you made me yourself, Clara. (<i>Sir WILLIAM comes forward, and speaks as
      if in a reverie.</i>) And ever more my friendship for her shall continue,
      though my guardianship is over. I am glad I conquered my indolence, and
      came to Ireland with her; for a cool English head will be wanting to guide
      that warm Irish heart.&mdash;And here I stand counsel for prudence against
      generosity!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> (<i>advancing to him playfully</i>) A silver penny for your
      thoughts, uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Shall I never teach you economy?&mdash;such extravagance! to
      give a penny, and a silver penny, for what you may have for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> Nothing can come of nothing&mdash;speak again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> I was thinking of you, my&mdash;<i>ward</i> no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> Ward always, pray, sir. Whatever I may be in the eye of the
      law, I am not arrived at years of discretion yet, in my own opinion, nor
      in yours, I suspect. So I pray you, uncle, let me still have the advantage
      of your counsel and guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> You ask for my advice, Clara. Now let me see whether you
      will take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> I am all attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> You know you must allow me a little prosing. You are an
      heiress, Clara&mdash;a rich heiress&mdash;an Irish heiress. You desire to
      do good, don&rsquo;t you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> (<i>with eagerness</i>) With all my heart!&mdash;With all my
      soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> That is not enough, Clara. You must not only desire to do
      good, you must know how to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> Since you, uncle, know that so well, you will teach it to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Dear, flattering girl&mdash;but you shall not flatter me out
      of the piece of advice I have ready for you. Promise me two things.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> And first, for your first.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> <i>Finish whatever you begin.</i>&mdash;Good beginnings, it
      is said, make good endings, but great beginnings often make little
      endings, or, in this country, no endings at all. <i>Finis coronat opta</i>&mdash;and
      that crown is wanting wherever I turn my eyes. Of the hundred magnificent
      things your munificent father began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> (<i>interrupting</i>) Oh, sir, spare my father!&mdash;I
      promise you that <i>I</i> will finish whatever I begin. What&rsquo;s your next
      command?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Promise me that you will never make a promise to a tenant,
      nor any agreement about business, but in writing&mdash;and empower me to
      say that you will never keep any verbal promise about business&mdash;then,
      none such will ever be claimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> I promise you&mdash;Stay!&mdash;this is a promise about
      business: I must give it to you in writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>Miss O&rsquo;HARA sits down to a writing-table, and writes.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> (<i>looking out of the window</i>) I hope I have been early
      enough in giving this my second piece of advice, worth a hundred sequins&mdash;for
      I see the yard is crowded with gray-coated suitors, and the table here is
      already covered with letters and petitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> Yes, uncle, but I have not read half of them yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>Presents the written promise to Sir WILLIAM.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Thank you, my dear; and you will be thankful to me for this
      when I am dead and gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> And whilst you are alive and here, if you please, uncle.
      Now, sir, since you are so kind to say that your time is at my disposal,
      will you have the goodness to come with me to these gray-coated suitors,
      and let us give answers to these poor petitioners, who, &ldquo;as in duty bound,
      will ever pray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      {<i>Takes up a bundle of papers.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> (<i>taking a letter from his pocket</i>) First, my dear
      niece, I must add to the number. I have a little business. A petition to
      present from a <i>protégé</i> of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> A protégé of yours!&mdash;Then it is granted, whatever it
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> (<i>smiling</i>) Recollect your promise, Clara.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> Oh, true&mdash;it must be in writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>She goes hastily to the writing-table, and takes up a pen.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Read before you write, my dear&mdash;I insist upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> Oh, sir, when it is a request of yours, how can I grant it
      soon enough? But it shall be done in the way you like best&mdash;slowly&mdash;deliberately&mdash;(<i>opening
      the letter</i>)&mdash;in minuet time. And I will look before I leap&mdash;and
      I&rsquo;ll read before I write. (<i>She reads the signature.</i>) Gilbert!
      Honest Gilbert, how glad I shall be to do any thing for you, independently
      of your master! (<i>Reads on, suddenly lets the letter drop, and clasps
      her hands.</i>) Sir&mdash;Uncle, my dear uncle, how unfortunate I am! Why
      did, not you ask me an hour ago?&mdash;Within this hour I have promised
      the new inn to another person.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Indeed!&mdash;that is unfortunate. My poor Gilbert will be
      sadly disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> How vexed I am! But I never should have thought of Gilbert
      for the inn: I fancied he disliked Ireland so much that he would never
      have settled here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> So thought I till this morning. But love, my dear&mdash;love
      is lord of all. Poor Gilbert!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> Poor Gilbert!&mdash;I am so sorry I did not know this
      sooner. Of all people, I should for my own part have preferred Gilbert for
      the inn, he would have kept it so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> He would so. (<i>Sighs.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> I do so blame myself&mdash;I have been so precipitate, so
      foolish, so wrong&mdash;without consulting you even.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Nay, my dear, I have been as wrong, as foolish, as
      precipitate as you; for before I consulted you, I told Gilbert that I
      could almost <i>promise</i> that he should have the inn in consequence of
      my recommendation. And upon the strength of that <i>almost</i> he is gone
      a courting. My dear, we are both a couple of fools; but I am an old&mdash;you
      are a young one. There is a wide difference&mdash;let that comfort you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> Oh, sir, nothing comforts me, I am so provoked with myself;
      and you will be so provoked with me, when I tell you how silly I have
      been.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Pray tell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> Would you believe that I have literally given it for a song?
      A man sent me this morning a copy of verses to the heiress of Bannow. The
      verses struck my fancy&mdash;I suppose because they flattered me; and with
      the verses came a petition setting forth claims, and a tenant&rsquo;s right, and
      fair promises, and a proposal for the new inn; and at the bottom of the
      paper I rashly wrote these words&mdash;&ldquo;<i>The poet&rsquo;s petition is granted.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> A promise in writing, too!&mdash;My dear Clara, I cannot
      flatter you&mdash;this certainly is not a wise transaction. So, to reward
      a poet, you made him an innkeeper. Well, I have known wiser heads, to
      reward a poet, make him an exciseman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> But, sir, I am not quite so silly as they were, for I did
      not <i>make</i> the poet an innkeeper&mdash;he is one already.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> An innkeeper already!&mdash;Whom do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> A man with a strange name&mdash;or a name that will sound
      strange to your English ears&mdash;Christy Gallagher.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> A rogue and a drunken dog, I understand: but he is a poet,
      and knows how to flatter the heiress of Bannow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> (<i>striking her forehead</i>) Silly, silly Clara!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> (<i>changing his tone from irony to kindness</i>) Come, my
      dear Clara, I will not torment you any more. You deserve to have done a
      great deal of mischief by your precipitation; but I believe this time you
      have done little or none, at least none that is irremediable; and you have
      made Gilbert happy, I hope and believe, though without intending it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> My dear uncle&mdash;you set my heart at ease&mdash;but
      explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Then, my dear, I shrewdly suspect that the daughter of this
      Christy <i>What-do-you-call-him</i> is the lady of Gilbert&rsquo;s thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> I see it all in an instant. That&rsquo;s delightful! We can
      pension off the drunken old father, and Gilbert and the daughter will keep
      the inn. Gilbert is in the green-house, preparing the coloured lamps&mdash;let
      us go and speak to him this minute, and settle it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Speak to him of his loves? Oh, my dear, you&rsquo;d kill him on
      the spot! He is so bashful, he&rsquo;d blush to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> Well, sir, do you go alone, and I will keep far, far aloof.

      up your head, child; there&rsquo;s money bid for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> Lord, father, what a thump on the back to salute one with.
      Well, sir, and if money is bid for me, no wonder: I suppose, it&rsquo;s because
      I have money.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> That&rsquo;s all the rason&mdash;you&rsquo;ve hit it, Florry. It&rsquo;s
      money that love always looks for now. So you may be proud to larn the news
      I have for you, which will fix Mr. Gilbert, your bachelor, for life, I&rsquo;ll
      engage&mdash;and make him speak out, you&rsquo;ll see, afore night-fall. We have
      the new inn, dear!&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got the promise here under her own
      hand-writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> Indeed!&mdash;Well, I&rsquo;m sure I shall be glad to get out of
      this hole, which is not fit for a rat or a Christian to live in&mdash;and
      I&rsquo;ll have my music and my piano in the back parlour, genteel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Oh! Ferrinafad, are you there? It&rsquo;s your husband must go
      to that expinse, my precious, if he chooses, <i>twingling</i> and <i>tweedling</i>,
      instead of the puddings and apple pies&mdash;that you&rsquo;ll settle betwix
      yees; and in the honeymoon, no doubt, you&rsquo;ve cunning enough to compass
      that, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> To be sure, sir, and before I come to the honeymoon, I
      promise you; for I won&rsquo;t become part or parcel of any man that ever wore a
      head, except he&rsquo;s music in his soul enough to allow me my piano in the
      back parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Asy! asy! Ferrinafad&mdash;don&rsquo;t be talking about the
      piano-forte, till you are married. Don&rsquo;t be showing the halter too soon to
      the shy horse&mdash;it&rsquo;s with the sieve of oats you&rsquo;ll catch him; and his
      head once in the sieve, you have the halter on him clane. Pray, after all,
      tell me, Florry, the truth&mdash;did Mr. Gilbert ever ax you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> La, sir, what a coarse question. His eyes have said as much
      a million of times.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> That&rsquo;s good&mdash;but not in law, dear. For, see, you
      could not <i>shue</i> a man in the four courts for a breach of promise
      made only with the eyes, jewel. It must be with the tongue afore witness,
      mind, or under the hand, sale, or mark&mdash;look to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> But, dear sir, Mr. Gilbert is so tongue-tied with that
      English bashfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Then Irish impudence must cut the string of that tongue,
      Florry. Lave that to me, unless you&rsquo;d rather yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> Lord, sir&mdash;what a rout about one man, when, if I
      please, I might have a dozen lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Be the same more or less. But one rich bachelor&rsquo;s worth a
      dozen poor, that is, for the article of a husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> And I dare say the drum-major is rich enough, sir&mdash;for
      all Scotchmen, they say, is fond of money and <i>a</i>conomie; and I&rsquo;d
      rather after all be the lady of a military man. (<i>Sings.</i>)

      it; for it&rsquo;s only turned up it is, when I was called off to send in
      dinner. So I believe I&rsquo;d best make it now, for the room will be wanting
      for the tea-drinking, and what not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> Ay, make the bed do, sure it&rsquo;s asy, and no more about it;&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      talked enough about it to make twinty beds, one harder nor the other,&mdash;if
      talk would do. (<i>BIDDY goes to make the bed.</i>) And I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s
      not a girl in the parish does less in the day, for all the talk you keep.
      Now I&rsquo;ll just tell all you didn&rsquo;t do, that you ought this day, Biddy.

      keep cool. Lave her now, and you may take your scould out another time. I
      want to spake to you. What&rsquo;s this I wanted to say? My memory&rsquo;s confusing
      itself. Oh, this was it&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t till you how I got this promise of
      the inn: I did it nately&mdash;I got it for a song.

    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> You&rsquo;re joking,&mdash;and I believe, sir, you&rsquo;re not over
      and above sober. There&rsquo;s a terrible strong smell of the whiskey.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> No, the whiskey&rsquo;s not strong, dear, at-all-at-all!&mdash;You
      may keep smelling what way you plase, but I&rsquo;m as sober as a judge, still,&mdash;and,
      drunk or sober, always knows and knewed on which side my bread was
      buttered:&mdash;got it for a song, I tell you&mdash;a bit of a

      SCENE IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>The Garden of the Widow LARKEN&rsquo;S Cottage.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>OWEN and MABEL.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> How does my mother bear the disappointment, Mabel about the
      inn?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> Then to outward appearance she did not take it so much to
      heart as I expected she would. But I&rsquo;m sure she frets inwardly&mdash;because
      she had been in such hopes, and in such spirits, and so proud to think how
      well her children would all be settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Oh, how sorry I am I told her in that hurry the good news I
      heard, and all to disappoint her afterwards, and break her heart with it!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> No, she has too good a heart to break for the likes. She&rsquo;ll
      hold up again after the first disappointment&mdash;she&rsquo;ll struggle on for
      our sakes, Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> She will: but Mabel dearest, what do you think of Gilbert?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> (<i>turning away</i>) I strive not to think of him at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> But sure I was not wrong there&mdash;he told me as much as
      that he loved you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> Then he never told me that much.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> No! What, not when he walked with you to the well?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> No. What made you think he did?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Why, the words he said about you when he met me, was&mdash;where&rsquo;s
      your sister Mabel? Gone to the well, Gilbert, says I. And do you think a
      man that has a question to ask her might make bold to step after her? says
      he. Such a man as you&mdash;why not? says I. Then he stood still, and
      twirled a rose he held in his hand, and he said nothing, and I no more,
      till he stooped down, and from the grass where we stood pulled a sprig of
      clover. Is not this what <i>you</i> call shamrock? says he. It is, says I.
      Then he puts the shamrock along with the rose&mdash;How would <i>that</i>
      do? says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> Did he say that, Owen?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Yes, or how would they look together? or, would they do
      together? or some words that way; I can&rsquo;t be particular to the word&mdash;you
      know, he speaks different from us; but that surely was the sense; and I
      minded too, he blushed up to the roots, and I pitied him, and answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> Oh, what did you answer?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> I answered and said, I thought they&rsquo;d do very well together;
      and that it was good when the Irish shamrock and the English rose was
      united.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> (<i>hiding her face with her hands</i>) Oh, Owen, that was
      too plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Plain! Not at all&mdash;it was not. It&rsquo;s only your tenderness
      makes you feel it too plain&mdash;for, listen to me, Mabel. (<i>Taking her
      hand from her face.</i>) Sure, if it had any meaning particular, it&rsquo;s as
      strong for Miss Gallagher as for any body else.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> That&rsquo;s true:&mdash;and may be it was that way he took it,&mdash;and
      may be it was her he was thinking of&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> When he asked me for you? But I&rsquo;ll not mislead you&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      say nothing; for it was a shame he did not speak out, after all the
      encouragement he got from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> Then did he get encouragement from you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> That is&mdash;(<i>smiling</i>)&mdash;taking it the other way,
      he might understand it so, if he had any conscience. Come now, Mabel, when
      he went to the well, what did he say to you? for I am sure he said
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> Then he said nothing&mdash;but just put the rose and
      shamrock into my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Oh! did he?&mdash;And what did you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> I said nothing.&mdash;What could I say?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Omen.</i> I wish I&rsquo;d been with you, Mabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> I&rsquo;m glad you were not, Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Well, what did he say next?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> I tell you he said nothing, but cleared his throat and
      hemmed, as he does often.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> What, all the way to the well and back, nothing but hem, and
      clear his throat?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> Nothing in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Why, then, the man&rsquo;s a fool or a rogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> Oh, don&rsquo;t say that, any way. But there&rsquo;s my mother coming in
      from the field. How weak she walks! I must go in to bear her company
      spinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> And I&rsquo;ll be in by the time I&rsquo;ve settled all here.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>Exit MABEL.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>OWEN, solus.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! I know how keenly Mabel feels all, tho&rsquo; she speaks so mild. Then I&rsquo;m
      cut to the heart by this behaviour of Gilbert&rsquo;s:&mdash;sure he could not
      be so cruel to be jesting with her!&mdash;he&rsquo;s an Englishman, and may be
      he thinks no harm to jilt an Irishwoman. But I&rsquo;ll show him&mdash;but then
      if he never asked her the question, how can we say any thing?&mdash;Oh!
      the thing is, he&rsquo;s a snug man, and money&rsquo;s at the bottom of all,&mdash;and
      since Christy&rsquo;s to have the new inn, and Miss Gallagher has the money!&mdash;Well,
      it&rsquo;s all over, and I don&rsquo;t know what will become of me.

      of the widow Larken.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. H.</i> Then I have to thank your family for their goodness to my
      puir brother, years ago. And for yourself, your friend, Mr. Christy
      Gallagher, has been telling me you can play the bugle?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> I can, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> And we want a bugle, and the <i>pay&rsquo;s</i> fifteen guineas;
      and I&rsquo;d sooner give it to you than three others that has applied, if
      you&rsquo;ll list.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Fifteen guineas! Oh! if I could send that money home to my
      mother! but I must ask her consint. Sir, she lives convanient, just in
      this cabin here&mdash;would you be pleased to step in with me, and I&rsquo;ll
      ask her consint.
    </p>

  Unfelt in sleep thy load of sorrow;

      {<i>MABEL turns and sees Mr. HOPE&mdash;She rises and curtsies.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> (<i>advancing softly</i>) I fear to disturb the mother,
      whose slumbers are so blest, and I&rsquo;d fain hear that lullaby again. If the

    </p>
    <p>

      of his name, a Serjeant Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> Ah! I mind&mdash;he that was sick with us, some time back.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> Ay, my brother that&rsquo;s dead, and that your gude mither was so
      tender of, when sick, charged me to thank you all, and so from my soul I
      do.

    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> &lsquo;Twas little my poor mother could do, nor any of us for him,
      even then, though we could do more then than we could now, and I&rsquo;m glad he
      chanced to be with us in our better days.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> And I&rsquo;m sorry you ever fell upon worse days, for you deserve
      the best; and will have such again, I trust. All I can say is this&mdash;that
      gif your brother here gangs with me, he shall find a brother&rsquo;s care
      through life fra&rsquo; me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt you; and that you know, Mabel, would be a
      great point, to have a friend secure in the regiment, if I thought of
      going.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> <i>If!</i>&mdash;Oh! what are you thinking of, Owen? What is
      it you&rsquo;re talking of going? (<i>Turning towards the door of her mother&rsquo;s
      room suddenly.</i>) Take care, but she&rsquo;d wake and hear you, and she&rsquo;d
      never sleep easy again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> And do you think so?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> Do I think so? Am not I sure of it? and you too, Owen, if
      you&rsquo;d take time to think and feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Why there&rsquo;s no doubt but it&rsquo;s hard, when the mother has
      reared the son, for him to quit her as soon as he can go alone; but it is
      what I was thinking: it is only the militia, you know, and I&rsquo;d not be
      going out of the three kingdoms ever at all; and I could be sending money
      home to my mother, like Johnny Reel did to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> Money is it? Then there&rsquo;s no money you could send her&mdash;not
      the full of Lough Erne itself, in golden guineas, could make her amends
      for the loss of yourself, Owen, and you know that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> And I am not the man that would entice you to list, or gang
      with me, in contradiction to your duty at home, or your interest abroad:
      so (<i>turning to</i> MABEL) do not look on me as the tempter to evil, nor
      with distrust, as you do, kind sister as you are, and like my own Kate;
      but hear me coolly, and without prejudice, for it is his gude I wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> I am listening then, and I ask your pardon if I looked a
      doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> The gude mother must wish, above all things here below, the
      weal and <i>advancement</i> and the honour of her bairns; and she would
      not let the son be tied to her apron-strings, for any use or profit to
      herself, but ever wish him to do the best in life for his sel&rsquo;. Is not
      this truth, gude friends&mdash;plain truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> It is then&mdash;I own that: truth and sense too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Now see there, Mabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> And better for him to do something abroad than digging at
      home; and in the army he might get on,&mdash;and here&rsquo;s the bugle-boy&rsquo;s
      pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> Is it a bugle-boy you are thinking of making him?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> That&rsquo;s the only thing I could make him. I wish I could offer
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> Then, I thank you, sir, and I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt ye&mdash;and it
      would be very well for a common boy that could only dig; but my brother&rsquo;s
      no common boy, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Oh, Mabel!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> Hush, Owen! for it&rsquo;s the truth I&rsquo;m telling, and if to your
      face I can&rsquo;t help it. You may hide the face, but I won&rsquo;t hide the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> Then speak on, my warm-hearted lassy, speak on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> Then, sir, he got an edication while ever my poor father
      lived, and no better scholar, they said, for the teaching he got:&mdash;but
      all was given over when the father died, and the troubles came, and Owen,
      as he ought, give himself up intirely for my mother, to help her, a widow.
      But it&rsquo;s not digging and slaving he is to be always:&mdash;it&rsquo;s with the
      head, as my father used to say, he&rsquo;ll make more than the hands; and we
      hope to get a clerk&rsquo;s place for him sometime, or there will be a
      schoolmaster wanting in this town, and that will be what he would be fit
      for; and not&mdash;but it&rsquo;s not civil, before you, a soldier, sir, to say
      the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> Fear not, you will not give offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> And not to be spending his breath blowing through a horn all
      his days, for the sake of wearing a fine red coat. I beg your pardon
      again, sir, if I say too much&mdash;but it&rsquo;s to save my brother and my
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> I like you the better for all you&rsquo;ve said for both.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> And I&rsquo;m off entirely:&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not list, I thank you, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      {<i>MABEL clasps her hands joyfully, then embraces her brother.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> And I&rsquo;ll not ask you to list&mdash;and I would not have
      asked it at all, but that a friend of yours told me it would be the
      greatest service I could do you, and that it was the thing of all others
      you wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> That friend was Christy Gallagher: but he was mistaken&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> I hope that&rsquo;s all. But I&rsquo;ve no dependance on him for a
      friend, nor has my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Why, he was saying to me, and I could not say against it,
      that he had a right to propose for the inn if he could, though Gilbert and
      we wanted to get it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mabel.</i> Then I wonder why Christy should be preferred rather than my
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Then that&rsquo;s a wonder&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t understand how that
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> I have one more thing to say, or to do, which I should like
      better, if you&rsquo;ll give me leave. If there&rsquo;s a difficulty aboot the rent of
      this new inn that you are talking of, I have a little spare money, and
      you&rsquo;re welcome to it:&mdash;I consider it as a debt of my brother&rsquo;s, which

      do.

      <i>Owen.</i> Alas! money won&rsquo;t do now, sir. It&rsquo;s all settled, and Christy
      says he has a promise of it in writing from the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> May be this Christy might sell his interest, and we will see&mdash;I

      I thank you kindly, sir, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go to the dance at-all-at-all, I

      <i>Mr. H.</i> This sister of yours would leave me no heart to carry back
      to Scotland, I fear, but that I&rsquo;m a married man already, and have my own
      luve&mdash;a Kate of my own, that&rsquo;s as fair as she, and as gude, and
      that&rsquo;s saying much.

      <i>Mr. H.</i> I shall thank you if you will teach me, for my Kate, the
      words of that song your sister was singing when we came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> I believe it&rsquo;s to flatter me you say this, for that song is
      my writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> Yours?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> Mine, such as it is.

    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> Sic a ane as you are then, I&rsquo;m glad you are not to be a
      bugle-boy: your sister is right.

    <p>
      <i>Owen.</i> I&rsquo;ll teach you the words as we go along.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> Do so;&mdash;but mind now this song-writing do not lead you
      to idleness. We must see to turn your edication to good account. (<i>Aside</i>)

      So this Scotchman could not list Owen. <i>Couldn&rsquo;t</i> nor <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i>,
      that&rsquo;s what he says; and the Scotchman looked very hard at me as he spoke:
      moreover, I seen Mr. Gilbert and him with their two heads close together,
      and that&rsquo;s a wonder, for I know Gilbert&rsquo;s not nat&rsquo;rally fond of any sort
      of Scotchman. There&rsquo;s something brewing:&mdash;I must have my wits about
      me, and see and keep sober this night, if I can, any way. From the first I
      suspicted Mr. Gilbert had his heart on Mabel. (BIDDY DOYLE <i>puts her
      head in</i>) Biddy Doyle! what the mischief does that head of yours do
      there?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> Nothing in life, sir: only just to see who was in it, along
      with yourself, because I thought I hard talking enough for two.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> You, girl, have curiosity enough for two, and two dozen,
      and too much! So plase take your head and yourself out of that, and don&rsquo;t
      be overharing my private thoughts; for that was all the talking ye hard,
      and <i>my</i> thoughts can&rsquo;t abide listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> I&rsquo;m no listener&mdash;I ax your pardon, sir: I scorn to

    <p>
      {<i>Exit BIDDY.</i>

    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> That girl has set me topsy-turvy. Where was I?&mdash;Oh!
      this was it. Suppose even, I say, suppose this Gilbert&rsquo;s fancy should
      stick to Mabel, I might manage him, nevertheless. I&rsquo;ve a great advantage
      and prerogative over this Englishman, in his having never been dipped in
      the Shannon. He is so <i>under cow</i> with bashfulness now, that I don&rsquo;t
      doubt but what in one of his confusions I could asy bring him to say Yes
      in the wrong place; and sooner than come to a perplexing refusal of a
      young lady, he might, I&rsquo;ll engage, be brought about to marry the girl he
      didn&rsquo;t like, in lieu of the girl he did. We shall see&mdash;but hark! I
      hear Ferrinafad&rsquo;s voice, singing, and I must join, and see how the thing&rsquo;s

    <p>
      <i>Miss GALLAGHER and GILBERT at a Tea-Table.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> (<i>aside</i>) Now would I give five golden guineas this
      minute that her father, or any mortal man, woman, or child in the varsal
      world, would come in and say something; for &lsquo;tis so awk&rsquo;ard for I to be
      sitting here, and I nothing to say to she.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> (<i>aside</i>) When will the man pay me the compliment to
      speak, I wonder? Wouldn&rsquo;t any body think he&rsquo;d no tongue in that mouth of
      his, screwed up, and blushing from ear to ear?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter CHRISTY.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Hoo! hoo! hoo!&mdash;How&rsquo;s this&mdash;both of yees mute as
      fishes the moment I come in? Why I hard you just now, when my back was
      turned, singing like turtle-doves&mdash;didn&rsquo;t I, Florry?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> Indeed, sir, as to turtle-doves, I&rsquo;m not sinsible; but Mr.
      Gilbert requisted of me to be favouring him with a song, which I was
      complying with, though I&rsquo;m not used to be singing without my piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> (<i>aside</i>) Sorrow take your piano! you&rsquo;re not come
      there yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> I wonder the drum-major isn&rsquo;t come yet. Does he expect tea
      can be keeping hot for him to the end of time? He&rsquo;ll have nothing but
      slop-dash, though he&rsquo;s a very genteel man. I&rsquo;m partial to the military
      school, I own, and a High lander too is always my white-headed boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> (<i>astonished</i>) Her white-headed boy!&mdash;Now, if I was
      to be hanged for it, I don&rsquo;t know what that means.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> Now where can you have lived, Mr. Gilbert, not to know <i>that</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> (<i>aside</i>) By the mass, he&rsquo;s such a
      matter-o&rsquo;-fact-man, I can&rsquo;t get round him with all my wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> Here&rsquo;s the drum-major! Scarlet&rsquo;s asy seen at a distance,
      that&rsquo;s one comfort!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter Mr. HOPE.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> I&rsquo;m late, Miss Florinda, I fear, for the tea-table; but I
      had a wee-wee bit of business to do for a young friend, that kept me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> No matter, major, my tapot defies you. Take a cup a tea.
      Are you fond of music, major?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> Very fond of music, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;do you sing or play?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> I do play&mdash;I plead guilty to that I own. But in this
      hole that we are in, there&rsquo;s no room fitting for my piano. However, in the
      new inn which we have got now, I&rsquo;ll fix my piano iligant in the
      back-parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> In the mean time, Miss Florinda, will you favour us with a
      song?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> And I&rsquo;ll be making the punch, for I&rsquo;m no songstress.
      Biddy! Biddy Doyle! hot water in a jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> Indeed I&rsquo;m not used to sing without my piano; but, to
      oblige the major, I&rsquo;ll sing by note.

      you now:&mdash;Mr. Gilbert, if you&rsquo;ve ever a love-song in your
      composition.

    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Then, Florry, we&rsquo;d best recommend it to the drum-major the
      next town he&rsquo;d go into, to put up an advertisement in capitals on his cap,
      warning all women whom it may consarn, that he is a married man.

      fifty guineas in gold, and if you will take them, and give me up the
      promise you have got of the new inn, you shall be welcome. That&rsquo;s all I
      have to say, if I was to talk till Christmas&mdash;and fewest words is

    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> Yes, but I can though: since you drive me to the wall, I must
      say no, and I do say no. And, dang it, I would have been hanged almost as
      soon as say so much to a father. I beg your pardon, sir, but my heart is
      given to another. Good evening to you.

      <i>Gilb.</i> Never.

    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Then I was&mdash;and I can tell you that I found to my
      cost, love was all in all with me before I was married, and after I had
      been married a twel&rsquo;-month, money was all in all with me; for I had the
      wife, and I had not the money, and without the money, the wife must have
      starved.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> But I can work, sir, and will, head, hands, and heart, for
      the woman I love.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Asy said&mdash;hard done. Mabel Larken is a very pretty
      girl. But wait till I tell you what Kit Monaghan said to me yesterday. I&rsquo;m
      going to be married, sir, says he to me. Ay, so you mintioned to me a
      fortnight ago, Kit, says I&mdash;to Rose Dermod, isn&rsquo;t it? says I. Not at
      all, sir, says he&mdash;it is to Peggy McGrath, this time. And what
      quarrel had you to Rose Dermod? says I. None in life, sir, says he; but
      Peggy McGrath had two cows, and Rose Dermod had but the one, and in my
      mind there is not the differ of a cow betwix&rsquo; one woman and another. Do
      you understand me now, Mr. Gilbert?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gilb.</i> Sir, we shall never understand one another&mdash;pray let me

      and in duty bound to push her as well as I can.

      <i>Gilb.</i> (<i>aside</i>) Why, to make up sixty, I must sell my watch
      even; but I&rsquo;ll do it&mdash;any thing to please Mabel. (<i>Aloud</i>) Well,
      sixty guineas, if you won&rsquo;t give it for less.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Done! (<i>Eagerly.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> Stay, stay, Mr. Gilbert! Have a care, Mr. Gallagher!&mdash;the
      lady might not be well pleased at your handing over her written promise,
      Mr. Gallagher&mdash;wait a wee bit. Don&rsquo;t conclude this bargain till you

    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Good night to ye kindly, gentlemen. There&rsquo;s a fool to love
      for you now! If I&rsquo;d ax&rsquo;d a hundred, I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; got it. But still there&rsquo;s only
      one thing. Ferrinafad will go mad when she learns I have sold the new inn,
      and she to live on in this hole, and no place for the piano. I hope Biddy
      did not hear a sentence of it. (<i>Calls</i>) Biddy! Biddy Doyle! Biddy,
      can&rsquo;t ye?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter Biddy.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Did you hear any thing? Oh, I see ye did by your eyes.
      Now, hark&rsquo;ee, my good girl: don&rsquo;t mention a sentence to Ferrinafad of my
      settling the new inn, till the bargain&rsquo;s complate, and money in both
      pockets&mdash;you hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> I do, sir. But I did not hear afore.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Becaase, she, though she&rsquo;s my daughter, she&rsquo;s crass&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      empty my mind to you, Biddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> (<i>aside</i>) He has taken enough to like to be talking to
      poor Biddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Afore Florry was set up on her high horse by that little
      independency her doting grandmother left her, and until she got her head
      turned with that Ferrinafad edication, this Florry was a good girl enough.
      But now what is she?&mdash;Given over to vanities of all sorts, and no
      comfort in life to me, or use at all&mdash;not like a daughter at all, nor
      mistress of the house neither, nor likely to be well married neither, or a
      credit to me that way! And saucy to me on account of that money of hers I
      liquidated unknown&rsquo;st.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> True for ye, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Then it all comes from the little finger getting to be the
      master of me; for I&rsquo;m confident that when sober, I was not born to be a
      rogue nat&rsquo;rally. Was not I honest Christy once? (<i>ready to cry.</i>) Oh,
      I&rsquo;m a great penitent! But there&rsquo;s no help for it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> True for you, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> I&rsquo;m an unfortunate cratur, and all the neighbours know it.&mdash;So,
      Biddy dear, I&rsquo;ve nothing for it but to take another glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> Oh! no, sir, not when you&rsquo;ll be going up to the castle to
      the lady&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be in no condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Tut, girl&mdash;&lsquo;twill give me heart. Let&rsquo;s be merry any
      way. {<i>Exit, singing,</i>

      people, and for speaking so kindly to them. One would think that you had
      lived in Ireland all your life, you know so well how to go <i>straight</i>
      to Irish heads and Irish hearts by kindness, and by what they love almost
      as well, <i>humour,</i> and good-humour. Thank you again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> My dear niece, you need not thank me; for if you had nothing
      to do with these people&mdash;if you had never been born&mdash;I should
      have loved the Irish for their own sakes. How easy it is to please them!
      How easy to make them happy; and how grateful they are, even for a few
      words of kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> Yes. This I may say without partiality&mdash;whatever other
      faults my countrymen have, they certainly are a grateful people. My
      father, who knew them well, taught me from my childhood, to trust to Irish
      gratitude.

      <i>Sir W.</i> (<i>changing his tone</i>) But, on the other hand, it is my
      duty to watch over your Irish generosity, Clara. Have you made any more

    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> Oh! no, sir; and I have heartily repented of that which I
      made this morning: for I find that this man to whom I have promised the

  Thy father&rsquo;s soul is in thy smile&mdash;
  Thrice blest his name in Erin&rsquo;s isle.
    The heart&rsquo;s warm welcome, Clara, meets thee;
    Thy native land, dear lady, greets thee.

  The bright star shining on the night,
  Betokening good, spreads quick delight;
  But quicker far, more glad surprise,
  Wakes the kind radiance of her eyes.
    The heart&rsquo;s warm welcome, Clara, meets thee;
    Thy native land, dear lady, greets thee{1}.

      <i>Christy.</i> Then I&rsquo;m not ashamed, any way, of that song of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> Of yours?&mdash;Is it possible that it is yours?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> It is indeed. These are the very lines he gave me this
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> And I humbly thank you, madam or miss, for having got them
      set to the musics.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> I had nothing to do with that. We must thank Mr. Hope for
      this agreeable surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Why, then, I thank you, Mr. Drum.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> You owe me no thanks, sir. I will take none from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> No&mdash;for I didn&rsquo;t remember giving you the copy. I
      suppose Florry did.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miss G.</i> Not I, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Or the schoolmaster&rsquo;s foul copy may be, for it was he was
      putting the song down for me on paper. My own hand-writing shaking so bad,
      I could not make a fair copy fit for the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> Mr. Gallagher, don&rsquo;t plunge farther in falsehood&mdash;you
      know the truth is, that song&rsquo;s not yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Why, then, by all&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> Stop, stop, Mr. Gallagher&mdash;stop, I advise you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Why, then, I won&rsquo;t stop at any thing&mdash;for the song&rsquo;s
      my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> In one sense of the word, may be, it may be called your own,
      sir; for you bought it, I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> I bought it? Oh, who put that in your Scotch brains?
      Whoever it was, was a big liar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> No liar at all, sir&mdash;I ax your pardon&mdash;&lsquo;twas I.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> And you overheard my thoughts, then, talking to myself&mdash;ye
      traitor!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Biddy.</i> No, sir&mdash;again I ax your pardon; no listener Biddy
      Doyle. But I was at the schoolmaster&rsquo;s, to get him pen a letter for me to
      my poor father, and there with him, I heard how Christy bought the song,
      and seen the first copy&mdash;and the child of the house told me all about
      it, and how it was lift there by Mr. Owen Larken.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> and <i>Clara</i> (<i>joyfully</i>). Owen Larken!&mdash;you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> All lies! Asy talk!&mdash;asy talk&mdash;asy to belie a
      poor man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. H.</i> If you tell the truth, you can tell us the next verse, for
      there&rsquo;s another which we did not yet sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Not in my copy, which is the original.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir W.</i> If you have another verse, let us hear it&mdash;and that
      will decide the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christy.</i> Oh, the devil another line, but what&rsquo;s lame, I&rsquo;ll engage,
      and forged, as you&rsquo;ll see.

    <p>
      <i>Clara.</i> What does Christy say now?

      <i>Sir W.</i> You see I was right, Gilbert; the Scotch make good friends.
      (<i>GILBERT bows.</i>) And now, Clara, my love, what shall we call the new

      united to obtain it, let the sign be the Rose, Thistle, and Shamrock.

    <h3>
      LETTER I.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Lady Olivia to Lady Leonora L&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a misfortune it is to be born a woman! In vain, dear Leonora, would
      you reconcile me to my doom. Condemned to incessant hypocrisy, or
      everlasting misery, woman is the slave or the outcast of society.
      Confidence in our fellow-creatures, or in ourselves, alike forbidden us,
      to what purpose have we understandings, which we may not use? hearts,
      which we may not trust? To our unhappy sex, genius and sensibility are the
      most treacherous gifts of heaven. Why should we cultivate talents merely
      to gratify the caprice of tyrants? Why seek for knowledge, which can prove
      only that our wretchedness is irremediable? If a ray of light break in
      upon us, it is but to make darkness more visible; to show us the narrow
      limits, the Gothic structure, the impenetrable barriers of our prison.
      Forgive me if on this subject I cannot speak&mdash;if I cannot think&mdash;with
      patience. Is it not fabled, that the gods, to punish some refractory
      mortal of the male kind, doomed his soul to inhabit upon earth a female
      form? A punishment more degrading, or more difficult to endure, could
      scarcely be devised by cruelty omnipotent. What dangers, what sorrows,
      what persecutions, what nameless evils await the woman who dares to rise
      above the prejudices of her sex!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Ah! happy they, the happiest of their kind!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      who, without a struggle, submit their reason to be swathed by all the
      absurd bandages of custom. What, though they cripple or distort their
      minds; are not these deformities beauties in the eyes of fashion? and are
      not these people the favoured nurselings of the <i>World</i>, secure of
      her smiles, her caresses, her fostering praise, her partial protection,
      through all the dangers of youth and all the dotage of age?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Ah! happy they, the happiest of their kind!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      who learn to speak, and think, and act by rote; who have a phrase, or a
      maxim, or a formula ready for every occasion; who follow&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;All the nurse and all the priest have taught.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And is it possible that Olivia can envy these <i>tideless-blooded</i>
      souls their happiness&mdash;their apathy? Is her high spirit so broken by
      adversity? Not such the promise of her early years, not such the language
      of her unsophisticated heart! Alas! I scarcely know, I scarcely recollect,
      that proud self, which was wont to defy the voice of opinion, and to set
      at nought the decrees of prejudice. The events of my life shall be
      related, or rather the history of my sensations; for in a life like mine,
      sensations become events&mdash;a metamorphosis which you will see in every
      page of my history. I feel an irresistible impulse to open my whole heart
      to you, my dear Leonora. I ought to be awed by the superiority of your
      understanding and of your character; yet there is an indulgence in your
      nature, a softness in your temper, that dissipates fear, and irresistibly
      attracts confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have generously refused to be prejudiced against me by busy, malignant
      rumour; you have resolved to judge of me for yourself. Nothing, then,
      shall be concealed. In such circumstances I cannot seek to extenuate any
      of my faults or follies. I am ready to acknowledge them all with
      self-humiliation more poignant than the sarcasms of my bitterest enemies.
      But I must pause till I have summoned courage for my confession. Dear
      Leonora, adieu!

      LETTER II.

    <h3>
      OLIVIA TO LEONORA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Full of life and spirits, with a heart formed for all the enthusiasm, for
      all the delicacy of love, I married early, in the fond expectation of
      meeting a heart suited to my own. Cruelly disappointed, I found&mdash;merely
      a husband. My heart recoiled upon itself; true to my own principles of
      virtue, I scorned dissimulation. I candidly confessed to my husband, that
      my love was extinguished. I proved to him, alas! too clearly, that we were
      not born for each other. The attractive moment of illusion was past&mdash;never
      more to return; the repulsive reality remained. The living was chained to
      the dead, and, by the inexorable tyranny of English laws, that chain,
      eternally galling to innocence, can be severed only by the desperation of
      vice. Divorce, according to our barbarous institutions, cannot be obtained
      without guilt. Appalled at the thought, I saw no hope but in submission.
      Yet to submit to live with the man I could not love was, to a mind like
      mine, impossible. My principles and my feelings equally revolted from this
      legal prostitution. We separated. I sought for balm to my wounded heart in
      foreign climes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the beauties of nature I was ever feelingly alive. Amidst the sublime
      scenes of Switzerland, and on the consecrated borders of her classic
      lakes, I sometimes forgot myself to happiness. Felicity, how transient!&mdash;transient
      as the day-dreams that played upon my fancy in the bright morning of love.
      Alas! not all creation&rsquo;s charms could soothe me to repose. I wandered in
      search of that which change of place cannot afford. There was an aching
      void in my heart&mdash;an indescribable sadness over my spirits. Sometimes
      I had recourse to books; but how few were in unison with my feelings, or
      touched the trembling chords of my disordered mind! Commonplace morality I
      could not endure. History presented nothing but a mass of crimes.
      Metaphysics promised some relief, and I bewildered myself in their not
      inelegant labyrinth. But to the bold genius and exquisite pathos of some
      German novelists I hold myself indebted for my largest portion of ideal
      bliss; for those rapt moments, when sympathy with kindred souls
      transported me into better worlds, and consigned vulgar realities to
      oblivion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am well aware, my Leonora, that you approve not of these my favourite
      writers: but yours is the morality of one who has never known sorrow. I
      also would interdict such cordials to the happy. But would you forbid
      those to taste felicity in dreams who feel only misery when awake? Would
      you dash the cup of Lethe from lips to which no other beverage is
      salubrious or sweet?
    </p>
    <p>
      By the use of these opiates my soul gradually settled into a sort of
      pleasing pensive melancholy. Has it not been said, that melancholy is a
      characteristic of genius? I make no pretensions to genius: but I am
      persuaded that melancholy is the habitual, perhaps the natural state of
      those who have the misfortune to feel with delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      You, my dear Leonora, will class this notion amongst what you once called
      my refined errors. Indeed I must confess, that I see in you an exception
      so striking as almost to compel me to relinquish my theory. But again let
      me remind you, that your lot in life has been different from mine. Alas!
      how different! Why had not I such a friend, such a mother as yours, early
      to direct my uncertain steps, and to educate me to happiness? I might have
      been&mdash;But no matter what I might have been&mdash;. I must tell you
      what I have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Separated from my husband, without a guide, without a friend at the most
      perilous period of my life, I was left to that most insidious of
      counsellors&mdash;my own heart&mdash;my own weak heart. When I was least
      prepared to resist the impression, it was my misfortune to meet with a man
      of a soul congenial with my own. Before I felt my danger, I was entangled
      beyond the possibility of escape. The net was thrown over my heart; its
      struggles were to no purpose but to exhaust my strength. Virtue commanded
      me to be miserable&mdash;and I was miserable. But do I dare to expect your
      pity, Leonora, for such an attachment? It excites your indignation,
      perhaps your horror. Blame, despise, detest me; all this would I rather
      bear, than deceive you into fancying me better than I really am.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not, however, think me worse. If my views had been less pure, if I had
      felt less reliance on the firmness of my own principles, and less
      repugnance to artifice, I might easily have avoided some appearances,
      which have injured me in the eyes of the world. With real contrition I
      confess, that a fatal mixture of masculine independence of spirit, and of
      female tenderness of heart, has betrayed me into many imprudences; but of
      vice, and of that meanest species of vice, hypocrisy, I thank Heaven, my
      conscience can acquit me. All I have now to hope is, that you, my
      indulgent, my generous Leonora, will not utterly condemn me. Truth and
      gratitude are my only claims to your friendship&mdash;to a friendship,
      which would be to me the first of earthly blessings, which might make me
      amends for all I have lost. Consider this before, unworthy as I am, you
      reject me from your esteem. Counsel, guide, save me! Without vanity, but
      with confidence I say it, I have a heart that will repay you for
      affection. You will find me easily moved, easily governed by kindness.
      Yours has already sunk deep into my soul, and your power is unlimited over
      the affections and over the understanding of
    </p>

    <p>
      FROM LADY LEONORA L&mdash;&mdash; TO HER MOTHER, THE DUCHESS OF &mdash;&mdash;,
      ENCLOSING THE PRECEDING LETTERS.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am permitted to send you, my dear mother, the enclosed letters. Mixed
      with what you may not approve, you will, I think, find in them proofs of
      an affectionate heart and superior abilities. Lady Olivia is just returned
      to England. Scandal, imported from the continent, has had such an effect
      in prejudicing many of her former friends and acquaintance against her,
      that she is in danger of being excluded from that society of which she was
      once the ornament and the favourite; but I am determined to support her
      cause, and to do every thing in my power to counteract the effects of
      malignity. I cannot sufficiently express the indignation that I feel
      against the mischievous spirit of scandal, which destroys happiness at
      every breath, and which delights in the meanest of all malignant feelings&mdash;the
      triumph over the errors of superior characters. Olivia has been much
      blamed, because she has been much envied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, my dear mother, you have been prejudiced against her by false
      reports. Do not imagine that her fascinating manners have blinded my
      judgment: I assure you that I have discerned, or rather that she has
      revealed to me, all her faults: and ought not this candour to make a
      strong impression upon my mind in her favour? Consider how young, how
      beautiful she was at her first entrance into fashionable life; how much
      exposed to temptation, surrounded by flatterers, and without a single
      friend. I am persuaded that she would have escaped all censure, and would
      have avoided all the errors with which she now reproaches herself, if she
      had been blessed with a mother such as mine.

    <h3>
      MY DEAREST CHILD,
    </h3>
    <p>
      I must answer your last before I sleep&mdash;before I can sleep in peace.
      I have just finished reading the rhapsody which it enclosed; and whilst my
      mind is full and warm upon the subject, let me write, for I can write to
      my own satisfaction at no other time. I admire and love you, my child, for
      the generous indignation you express against those who trample upon the
      fallen, or who meanly triumph over the errors of superior genius; and if I
      seem more cold, or more severe, than you wish me to be, attribute this to
      my anxiety for your happiness, and to that caution which is perhaps the
      infirmity of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of my long life I have, alas! seen vice and folly dressed in
      so many different fashions, that I can find no difficulty in detecting
      them under any disguise; but your unpractised eyes are almost as easily
      deceived as when you were five years old, and when you could not believe
      that your pasteboard nun was the same person in her various changes of
      attire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing would tempt you to associate with those who have avowed themselves
      regardless of right and wrong; but I must warn you against another, and a
      far more dangerous class, who professing the most refined delicacy of
      sentiment, and boasting of invulnerable virtue, exhibit themselves in the
      most improper and hazardous situations; and who, because they are without
      fear, expect to be deemed free from reproach. Either from miraculous good
      fortune, or from a singularity of temper, these adventurous heroines may
      possibly escape with what they call perfect innocence. So much the worse
      for society. Their example tempts others, who fall a sacrifice to their
      weakness and folly. I would punish the tempters in this case more than the
      victims, and for them the most effectual species of punishment is
      contempt. Neglect is death to these female lovers of notoriety. The moment
      they are out of fashion their power to work mischief ceases. Those who
      from their character and rank have influence over public opinion are bound
      to consider these things in the choice of their associates. This is
      peculiarly necessary in days when attempts are made to level all
      distinctions. You have sometimes hinted to me, my dear daughter, with all
      proper delicacy, that I am too strict in my notions, and that, unknown to
      myself, my pride mixes with morality. Be it so: the pride of family, and
      the pride of virtue, should reciprocally support each other. Were I asked
      what I think the best guard to a nobility in this or in any other country,
      I should answer, VIRTUE. I admire that simple epitaph in Westminster Abbey
      on the Duchess of Newcastle:&mdash;&ldquo;Her name was Margaret Lucas, youngest
      sister to the Lord Lucas of Colchester;&mdash;a noble family, for all the
      brothers were valiant and all the sisters virtuous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I look to the temper of the times in forming rules for conduct. Of late
      years we have seen wonderful changes in female manners. I may be like the
      old marquis in Gil Blas, who contended that even the peaches of modern
      days had deteriorated; but I fear that my complaints of the degeneracy of
      human kind are better founded, than his fears for the vegetable creation.
      A taste for the elegant profligacy of French gallantry was, I remember,
      introduced into this country before the destruction of the French
      monarchy. Since that time, some sentimental writers and pretended
      philosophers of our own and foreign countries, have endeavoured to
      confound all our ideas of morality. To every rule of right they have found
      exceptions, and on these they have fixed the public attention by adorning
      them with all the splendid decorations of eloquence; so that the rule is
      despised or forgotten, and the exception triumphantly established in its
      stead. These orators seem as if they had been employed by Satan to plead
      the cause of vice; and, as if possessed by the evil spirit, they speak
      with a vehemence which carries away their auditors, or with a subtlety
      which deludes their better judgment. They put extreme cases, in which
      virtue may become vice, or vice virtue: they exhibit criminal passions in
      constant connexion with the most exalted, the most amiable virtues; thus
      making use of the best feelings of human nature for the worst purposes,
      they engage pity or admiration perpetually on the side of guilt. Eternally
      talking of philosophy or philanthropy, they borrow the terms only to
      perplex the ignorant and seduce the imagination. They have their systems
      and their theories, and in theory they pretend that the general good of
      society is their sole immutable rule of morality, and in practice they
      make the variable feelings of each individual the judges of this general
      good. Their systems disdain all the vulgar virtues, intent upon some <i>beau
      ideal</i> of perfection or perfectibility. They set common sense and
      common honesty at defiance. No matter: their doctrine, so convenient to
      the passions and soporific to the conscience, can never want partisans;
      especially by weak and enthusiastic women it is adopted and propagated
      with eagerness; then they become personages of importance, and zealots in
      support of their sublime opinions; and they can read,&mdash;and they can
      write,&mdash;and they can talk,&mdash;and they can <i>effect a revolution
      in public opinion</i>! I am afraid, indeed, that they can; for of late
      years we have heard more of sentiment than of principles; more of the
      rights of woman than of her duties. We have seen talents disgraced by the
      conduct of their possessors, and perverted in the vain attempt to defend
      what is unjustifiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where must all this end? Where the abuse of reason inevitably ends&mdash;in
      the ultimate law of force. If, in this age of reason, women make a bad use
      of that power which they have obtained by the cultivation of their
      understanding, they will degrade and enslave themselves beyond redemption;
      they will reduce their sex to a situation worse than it ever experienced
      even in the ages of ignorance and superstition. If men find that the
      virtue of women diminishes in proportion as intellectual cultivation
      increases, they will connect, fatally for the freedom and happiness of our
      sex, the ideas of female ignorance and female innocence; they will decide
      that one is the effect of the other. They will not pause to distinguish
      between the use and the abuse of reason; they will not stand by to see
      further experiments tried at their expense, but they will prohibit
      knowledge altogether as a pernicious commodity, and will exert the
      superior power which nature and society place in their hands, to enforce
      their decrees. Opinion obtained freedom for women; by opinion they may be
      again enslaved. It is therefore the interest of the female world, and of
      society, that women should be deterred by the dread of shame from passing
      the bounds of discretion. No false lenity, no partiality in favour of
      amusing talents or agreeable manners, should admit of exceptions which
      become dangerous examples of impunity. The rank and superior understanding
      of a <i>delinquent</i> ought not to be considered in mitigation, but as
      aggravating circumstances. Rank makes ill conduct more conspicuous:
      talents make it more dangerous. Women of abilities, if they err, usually
      employ all their powers to justify rather than to amend their faults.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am afraid, my dear daughter, that my general arguments are closing round
      your Olivia; but I must bid you a good night, for my poor eyes will serve
      me no longer. God bless you, my dear child.

    <h3>
      LETTER V.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      LEONORA TO HER MOTHER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I agree with you, my dear mother, that in these times especially it is
      incumbent upon all persons, whose rank or reputation may influence public
      opinion, to be particularly careful to support the cause of female honour,
      of virtue, and religion. With the same object in view, we may however
      differ in the choice of means for its attainment. Pleasure as well as pain
      acts upon human creatures; and therefore, in governing them, may not
      reward be full as efficacious as punishment? Our sex are sufficiently
      apprised of the fatal consequences of ill conduct; the advantages of
      well-earned reputation should be at least as great, as certain, and as
      permanent.
    </p>
    <p>
      In former times, a single finger pointed at the scutcheon of a knight
      challenged him to defend his fame; but the defiance was open, the defence
      was public; and if the charge proved groundless, it injured none but the
      malicious accuser. In our days, female reputation, which is of a nature
      more delicate than the honour of any knight, may be destroyed by the
      finger of private malice. The whisper of secret scandal, which admits of
      no fair or public answer, is too often sufficient to dishonour a life of
      spotless fame. This is the height, not only of injustice, but of impolicy.
      Women will become indifferent to reputation, which it is so difficult,
      even by the prudence of years, to acquire, and which it is so easy to lose
      in a moment, by the malice or thoughtlessness of those, who invent, or who
      repeat scandal. Those who call themselves the world, often judge without
      listening to evidence, and proceed upon suspicion with as much promptitude
      and severity, as if they had the most convincing proofs. But because
      Cæsar, nearly two thousand years ago, said that his wife ought not even to
      be suspected, and divorced her upon the strength of this sentiment, shall
      we make it a general maxim that suspicion justifies punishment? We might
      as well applaud those, who when their friends are barely suspected to be
      tainted with the plague, drive them from all human comfort and assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even where women, from the thoughtless gaiety of youth, or the impulse of
      inexperienced enthusiasm, may have given some slight cause for censure, I
      would not have virtue put on all her gorgon terrors, nor appear circled by
      the vengeful band of prudes; her chastening hand will be more beneficially
      felt if she wear her more benign form. To place the imprudent in the same
      class with the vicious, is injustice and impolicy; were the same
      punishment and the same disgrace to be affixed to small and to great
      offences, the number of <i>capital</i> offenders would certainly increase.
      Those who were disposed to yield to their passions would, when they had
      once failed in exact decorum, see no motive, no fear to restrain them; and
      there would be no pause, no interval between error and profligacy. Amongst
      females who have been imprudent, there are many things to be considered
      which ought to recommend them to mercy. The judge, when he is obliged to
      pronounce the immutable sentence of the law, often, with tears, wishes
      that it were in his power to mitigate the punishment: the decisions of
      opinion may and must vary with circumstances, else the degree of
      reprobation which they inflict cannot be proportioned to the offence, or
      calculated for the good of society. Among the mitigating circumstances, I
      should be inclined to name even, those which you bring in aggravation.
      Talents, and what is called genius, in our sex are often connected with a
      warmth of heart, an enthusiasm of temper, which expose to dangers, from
      which the coldness of mediocrity is safe. In the illuminated palace of
      ice, the lights which render the spectacle splendid, and which raise the
      admiration of the beholders, endanger the fabric and tend to its
      destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you will tell me, dear mother, that allusion is not argument&mdash;and
      I am almost afraid to proceed, lest you should think me an advocate for
      vice. I would not shut the gates of mercy, inexorably and
      indiscriminately, upon all those of my own sex, who have even been <i>more
      than imprudent</i>.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;He taught them shame, the sudden sense of ill&mdash;
    Shame, Nature&rsquo;s hasty conscience, which forbids
  Weak inclination ere it grows to will,
    Or stays rash will before it grows to deeds.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Whilst a woman is alive to shame she cannot be dead to virtue. But by
      injudicious or incessant reproach, this principle, even where it is most
      exquisite, may be most easily destroyed. The mimosa, when too long exposed
      to each rude touch, loses its retractile sensibility. It ought surely to
      be the care of the wise and benevolent to cherish that principle,
      implanted in our nature as the guard of virtue, that principle, upon which
      legislators rest the force of punishment, and all the grand interests of
      society.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear mother, perhaps you will be surprised at the style in which I have
      been writing, and you will smile at hearing your Leonora discuss the
      duties of legislators and the grand interests of society. She has not done
      so from presumption, or from affectation. She was alarmed by your
      supposing that her judgment was deluded by fascinating manners, and she
      determined to produce <i>general</i> arguments, to convince you that she
      is not actuated by particular prepossession. You see that I have at least
      some show of reason on <i>my</i> side. I have forborne to mention Olivia&rsquo;s
      name: but now that I have obviated, I hope by reasoning, the imputation of
      partiality, I may observe that all my arguments are strongly in her
      favour. She had been attacked by slander; <i>the world</i> has condemned
      her upon suspicion merely. She has been imprudent; but I repeat, in the
      strongest terms, that I am <i>convinced of her innocence</i>; and that I
      should bitterly regret that a woman with such an affectionate heart, such
      uncommon candour, and such superior abilities, should be lost to society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tell me, my dear mother, that you are no longer in anxiety about the
      consequences of my attachment to Olivia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your affectionate daughter,

    <h3>
      LETTER VI.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      THE DUCHESS OF &mdash;&mdash; TO HER DAUGHTER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      You lament, my dear child, that such an affectionate heart, such great
      abilities as Olivia&rsquo;s, should be lost to society. Before I sympathize in
      your pity, my judgment must be convinced that it is reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      What proofs has Lady Olivia given of her affectionate heart? She is at
      variance with both her parents; she is separated from her husband; and she
      leaves her child in a foreign country, to be educated by strangers. Am I
      to understand, that her ladyship&rsquo;s neglecting to perform the duties of a
      daughter, a wife, and a mother, are proofs of an affectionate heart? As to
      her superior talents, do they contribute to her own happiness, or to the
      happiness of others? Evidently not to her own; for by her account of
      herself, she is one of the most miserable wretches alive! She tells you
      that &ldquo;<i>she went to foreign climes in search of balm for a wounded heart,
      and wandered from place to place, looking for what no place could afford</i>.&rdquo;
       She talks of &ldquo;<i>indescribable sadness&mdash;an aching void&mdash;an
      impenetrable prison&mdash;darkness visible&mdash;dead bodies chained to
      living ones</i>;&rdquo; and she exhibits all the disordered furniture of a
      &ldquo;diseased mind.&rdquo; But you say, that though her powers are thus insufficient
      to make herself happy, they may amuse or instruct the world; and of this I
      am to judge by the letters which you have sent me. You admire fine
      writing; so do I. I class eloquence high amongst the fine arts. But by
      eloquence I mean something more than Dr. Johnson defines it to be, &ldquo;the
      art of speaking with fluency and elegance.&rdquo; This is an art which is now
      possessed to a certain degree by every boarding-school miss. Every
      scribbling young lady can now string sentences and sentiments together,
      and can turn a period harmoniously. Upon the strength of these
      accomplishments they commence heroines, and claim the privileges of the
      order; privileges which go to an indefinite and most alarming extent.
      Every heroine may have her own code of morality for her private use, and
      she is to be tried by no other; she may rail as loudly as she pleases &ldquo;at
      the barbarous institutions of society,&rdquo; and may deplore &ldquo;<i>the inexorable
      tyranny of the English laws</i>.&rdquo; If she find herself involved in delicate
      entanglements of crossing duties, she may break through any one, or all of
      them, to extricate herself with a noble contempt of prejudice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have promised to reason calmly; but I cannot repress the terror which I
      feel at the idea of my daughter&rsquo;s becoming the friend of one of these
      women. Olivia&rsquo;s letters are, I think, in the true heroine style; and they
      might make a brilliant figure in a certain class of novels. She begins
      with a bold exclamation on &ldquo;the misfortune of being born a woman!&mdash;<i>the
      slave or the outcast of society, condemned to incessant hypocrisy</i>!&rdquo;
       Does she mean modesty? Her manly soul feels it &ldquo;<i>the most degrading
      punishment that omnipotent cruelty could devise, to be imprisoned in a
      female form</i>.&rdquo; From such a masculine spirit some fortitude and
      magnanimity might be expected; but presently she begs to be pitied, for a
      broken spirit, and more than female tenderness of heart. I have observed
      that the ladies who wish to be men, are usually those who have not
      sufficient strength of mind to be women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Olivia proceeds in an ironical strain to envy, as &ldquo;<i>the happiest of
      their sex, those who submit to be swathed by custom</i>.&rdquo; These persons
      she stigmatizes with the epithet of <i>tideless-blooded</i>. It is the
      common trick of unprincipled women to affect to despise those who conduct
      themselves with propriety. Prudence they term <i>coldness</i>; fortitude,
      <i>insensibility;</i> and regard to the rights of others, <i>prejudice</i>.
      By this perversion of terms they would laugh or sneer virtue out of
      countenance; and, by robbing her of all praise, they would deprive her of
      all immediate motive. Conscious of their own degradation, they would lower
      every thing, and every body, to their own standard: they would make you
      believe, that those who have not yielded to their passions are destitute
      of sensibility; that the love which is not blazoned forth in glaring
      colours is not entitled to our sympathy. The sacrifice of the strongest
      feelings of the human heart to a sense of duty is to be called mean, or
      absurd; but the shameless frenzy of passion, exposing itself to public
      gaze, is to be an object of admiration. These heroines talk of strength of
      mind; but they forget that strength of mind is to be shown in resisting
      their passions, not in yielding to them. Without being absolutely of an
      opinion, which I have heard maintained, that all virtue is sacrifice, I am
      convinced that the essential characteristic of virtue is to bear and
      forbear. These sentimentalists can do neither. They talk of sacrifices and
      generosity; but they are the veriest egotists&mdash;the most selfish
      creatures alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open your eyes, my dear Leonora, and see things as they really are. Lady
      Olivia thinks it a sufficient excuse for abandoning her husband, to say,
      that she found &ldquo;<i>his soul was not in unison with hers</i>.&rdquo; She thinks
      it an adequate apology for a criminal attachment, to tell you that &ldquo;<i>the
      net was thrown over her heart before she felt her danger: that all its
      struggles were to no purpose, but to exhaust her strength</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If she did not feel her danger, she prepared it. The course of reading
      which her ladyship followed was the certain preparation for her subsequent
      conduct. She tells us that she could not endure &ldquo;<i>the common-place of
      morality, but metaphysics promised her some relief</i>.&rdquo; In these days a
      heroine need not be amoralist, but she must be a metaphysician. She must &ldquo;<i>wander
      in the not inelegant labyrinth</i>;&rdquo; and if in the midst of it she comes
      unawares upon the monster vice, she must not start, though she have no
      clue to secure her retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      From metaphysics Lady Olivia went on to German novels. &ldquo;<i>For her largest
      portions of bliss, for those rapt moments, which consigned vulgar
      realities to oblivion</i>,&rdquo; she owns herself indebted to those writers,
      who promise an ideal world of pleasure, which, like the <i>mirage</i> in
      the desert, bewilders the feverish imagination. I always suspected the
      imagination of these <i>women of feeling</i> to be more susceptible than
      their hearts. They want excitation for their morbid sensibility, and they
      care not at what expense it is procured. If they could make all the
      pleasures of life into one cordial, they would swallow it at a draught in
      a fit of sentimental spleen. The mental intemperance that they indulge in
      promiscuous novel-reading destroys all vigour and clearness of judgment;
      every thing dances in the varying medium of their imagination. Sophistry
      passes for reasoning; nothing appears profound but what is obscure;
      nothing sublime but what is beyond the reach of mortal comprehension. To
      their vitiated taste the simple pathos, which o&rsquo;ersteps not the modesty of
      nature, appears cold, tame, and insipid; they must have <i>scènes</i> and
      a <i>coup de théâtre</i>; and ranting, and raving, and stabbing, and
      drowning, and poisoning; for with them there is no love without murder.
      Love, in their representations, is indeed a distorted, ridiculous, horrid
      monster, from whom common sense, taste, decency, and nature recoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I will be calm.&mdash;You say, my dear Leonora, that your judgment has
      not been blinded by Lady Olivia&rsquo;s fascinating manners; but that you are
      strongly influenced in her favour by that candour, with which she has
      revealed to you all her faults. The value of candour in individuals should
      be measured by their sensibility to shame. When a woman throws off all
      restraint, and then desires me to admire her candour, I am astonished only
      at her assurance. Do not be the dupe of such candour. Lady Olivia avows a
      criminal passion, yet you say that you have no doubt of her innocence. The
      persuasion of your unsuspecting heart is no argument: when you give me any
      proofs in her favour, I shall pay them all due attention. In the mean time
      I have given you my opinion of those ladies who place themselves in the
      most perilous situations, and then expect you to believe them safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Olivia&rsquo;s professions of regard for you are indeed enthusiastic. She tells
      you, that &ldquo;<i>your power is unlimited over her heart and understanding;
      that your friendship would be to her one of the greatest of earthly
      blessings</i>.&rdquo; May be so&mdash;but I cannot wish you to be her friend.
      With whatever confidence she makes the assertion, do not believe that she
      has a heart capable of feeling the value of yours. These sentimental,
      unprincipled women make the worst friends in the world. We are often told
      that, &ldquo;poor creatures! they do nobody any harm but themselves;&rdquo; but in
      society it is scarcely possible for a woman to do harm to herself, without
      doing harm to others; all her connexions must be involved in the
      consequences of her imprudence. Besides, what confidence can you repose in
      them? If you should happen to be an obstacle in the way of any of their
      fancies, do you think that they will respect you or your interest, when
      they have not scrupled to sacrifice their own to the gratification of
      their passions? Do you think that the gossamer of sentiment will restrain
      those whom the strong chains of prudence could not hold?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! my dearest child, forcibly as these arguments carry conviction to my
      mind, I dread lest your compassionate, generous temper, should prevent
      their reaching your understanding. Then let me conjure you, by all the
      respect which you have ever shown for your mother&rsquo;s opinions, by all that
      you hold dear or sacred, beware of forming an intimacy with an
      unprincipled woman. Believe me to be

    </h3>
    <p>
      No daughter ever felt more respect for the opinions of a parent than I do
      for yours, my dearest mother; but you have never, even from childhood,
      required from me a blind submission&mdash;you have always encouraged me to
      desire conviction. And now, when the happiness of another is at stake, you
      will forgive me if I am less disposed to yield than I should be, I hope,
      if my own interest or taste were alone concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      You ask me what proofs I have of Lady Olivia&rsquo;s innocence. Believe me, I
      have such as are convincing to my unbiassed judgment, and such as would be
      sufficient to satisfy all your doubts, were I at liberty to lay the whole
      truth before you. But even to exculpate herself, Olivia will not ruin in
      your opinion her husband, of whom you imagine that she has no reason to
      complain. I, who know how anxious she is to obtain your esteem, can
      appreciate the sacrifice that she makes; and in this instance, as in many
      others, I admire her magnanimity; it is equal to her candour, for which
      she is entitled to praise even by your own principles, dear mother: since,
      far from having <i>thrown off all restraint</i>, she is exquisitely
      susceptible of shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to her understanding&mdash;have no persons of great talents ever been
      unfortunate? Frequently we see that they have not been able, by all their
      efforts and all their powers, to remedy the defects in the characters and
      tempers of those with whom they have unhappily been connected. Olivia
      married very young, and was unfortunately mistaken in her choice of a
      husband: on that subject I can only deplore her error and its
      consequences: but as to her disagreements with her own family, I do not
      think her to blame. For the mistakes we make in the choice of lovers or
      friends we may be answerable, but we cannot be responsible for the faults
      of the relations who are given to us by nature. If we do not please them,
      it may be our misfortune; it is not necessarily our fault. I cannot be
      more explicit, without betraying Lady Olivia&rsquo;s confidence, and implicating
      others in defending her.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to that attachment of which you speak with so much just
      severity, she has given me the strongest assurances that she will do every
      thing in her power to conquer it. Absence, you know, is the first and the
      most difficult step, and this she has taken. Her course of reading
      displeases you: I cannot defend it: but I am persuaded that it is not a
      proof of her taste being vitiated. Many people read ordinary novels as
      others take snuff, merely from habit, from the want of petty excitation;
      and not, as you suppose, from the want of exorbitant or improper stimulus.
      Those who are unhappy have recourse to any trifling amusement that can
      change the course of their thoughts. I do not justify Olivia for having
      chosen such <i>comforters</i> as certain novels, but I pity her, and
      impute this choice to want of fortitude, not to depravity of taste. Before
      she married, a strict injunction was laid upon her not to read any book
      that was called a novel: this raised in her mind a sort of perverse
      curiosity. By making any books or opinions contraband, the desire to read
      and circulate them is increased; bad principles are consequently smuggled
      into families, and being kept secret, can never be subject to fair
      examination. I think it must be advantageous to the right side of any
      question, that all which can be said against it should be openly heard,
      that it may be answered. I do not
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Hate when vice can bolt her arguments;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      for I know that virtue has a tongue to answer her. The more vice repeats
      her assertions, the better; because when familiarized, their boldness will
      not astound the understanding, and the charm of novelty will not be
      mistaken for the power of truth. We may observe, that the admiration for
      the class of writers to whom you allude, though violent in its
      commencement, has abated since they have been more known; and numbers, who
      began with rapture, have ended with disgust. Persons of vivacious
      imaginations, like Olivia, may be caught at first view by whatever has the
      appearance of grandeur or sublimity; but if time be allowed for
      examination, they will infallibly detect the disproportions, and these
      will ever afterwards shock their taste: if you will not allow leisure for
      comparison&mdash;if you say, do not look at such strange objects, the
      obedient eyes may turn aside, but the rebel imagination pictures something
      a thousand times more wonderful and charming than the reality. I will
      venture to predict, that Olivia will soon be tired of the species of
      novels which she now admires, and that, once surfeited with these books,
      and convinced of their pernicious effects, she will never relapse into the
      practice of novel reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to her taste for metaphysical books&mdash;Dear mother, I am very daring
      to differ with you in so many points; but permit me to say, that I do not
      agree with you in detesting metaphysics. People may lose themselves in
      that labyrinth; but why should they meet with vice in the midst of it? The
      characters of a moralist, a practical moralist, and a metaphysician, are
      not incompatible, as we may see in many amiable and illustrious examples.
      To examine human motives, and the nature of the human mind, is not to
      destroy the power of virtue, or to increase the influence of vice. The
      chemist, after analyzing certain substances, and after discovering their
      constituent parts, can lay aside all that is heterogeneous, and recompound
      the substance in a purer state. From analogy we might infer, that the
      motives of metaphysicians ought to be purer than those of the vulgar and
      ignorant. To discover the art of converting base into noble passions, or
      to obtain a universal remedy for all mental diseases, is perhaps beyond
      the power of metaphysicians; but in the pursuit, useful discoveries may be
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Olivia&rsquo;s letters&mdash;I am sorry I sent them to you; for I see that
      they have lowered, instead of raising her in your opinion. But if you
      criticise letters, written in openness and confidence of heart to a
      private friend, as if they were set before the tribunal of the public, you
      are&mdash;may I say it?&mdash;not only severe, but unjust; for you try and
      condemn the subjects of one country by the laws of another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dearest mother, be half as indulgent to Olivia as you are to me: indeed
      you are prejudiced against her; and because you see some faults, you think
      her whole character vicious. But would you cut down a fine tree because a
      leaf is withered, or because the canker-worm has eaten into the bud? Even
      if a main branch were decayed, are there not remedies which, skilfully
      applied, can save the tree from destruction, and perhaps restore it to its
      pristine beauty?
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, having exhausted all my allusions, all my arguments, and all my
      little stock of eloquence, I must come to a plain matter of fact&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I received your letter I had invited Lady Olivia to spend some time
      at L&mdash;&mdash; Castle. I fear that you will blame my precipitation,
      and I reproach myself for it, because I know it will give you pain.
      However, though you will think me imprudent, I am certain you would rather
      that I were imprudent than unjust. I have defended Olivia from what I
      believe to be unmerited censure; I have invited her to my house; she has
      accepted my proffered kindness; to withdraw it afterwards would be doing
      her irreparable injury: it would confirm all that the world can suspect:
      it would be saying to the censorious&mdash;I am convinced that you are
      right, and I deliver your victim up to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus I should betray the person whom I undertook to defend: her confidence
      in me, her having but for a moment accepted my protection, would be her
      ruin. I could not act in so base a manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fear nothing for me, my best, but too anxious, friend. I may do Lady
      Olivia some good; she can do me no harm. She may learn the principles
      which you have taught me; I can never catch from her any tastes or habits
      which you would disapprove. As to the rest, I hazard little or nothing.
      The hereditary credit which I enjoy in my maternal right enables me to
      assist others without injuring myself.

    </h3>
    <p>
      Prepare yourself, my ever dear and charming Gabrielle, for all the
      torments of jealousy. Know, that since I came to England I have formed a
      new friendship with a woman who is interesting in the extreme, who has
      charmed me by the simplicity of her manners and the generous sensibility
      of her heart. Her character is certainly too reserved: yet even this
      defect has perhaps increased her power over my imagination, and
      consequently over my affections. I know not by what magic she has obtained
      it, but she has already an ascendancy over me, which would quite astonish
      <i>you</i>, who know my wayward fancies and independent spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! I confess my heart is weak indeed; and I fear that all the power of
      friendship and philosophy combined will never strengthen it sufficiently.
      Oh, Gabrielle! how can I hope to obliterate from my soul that attachment
      which has marked the colour of my destiny for years? Yet such courage,
      such cruel courage is required of me, and of such I have boasted myself
      capable. Lady Leonora L&mdash;&mdash;, my new friend, has, by all the
      English eloquence of virtue, obtained from me a promise, which, I fear, I
      shall not have the fortitude to keep&mdash;but I must make the attempt&mdash;Forbid
      R&mdash;&mdash; to write to me&mdash;Yes! I have written the words&mdash;Forbid
      R&mdash;&mdash; to write to me&mdash;Forbid him to think of me&mdash;I
      will do more&mdash;if possible I will forbid myself henceforward to think
      of him&mdash;to think of love&mdash;Adieu, my Gabrielle&mdash;All the
      illusions of life are over, and a dreary blank of future existence lies
      before me, terminated only by the grave. To-morrow I go to L&mdash;&mdash;
      Castle, with feelings which I can compare only to those of the unfortunate
      La Vallière when she renounced her lover, and resolved to bury herself in
      a cloister.&mdash;Alas! why have not I the resource of devotion?

    <p>
      Publish my travels!&mdash;Not I, my dear friend. The world shall never
      have the pleasure of laughing at General B&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s trip to Paris.
      Before a man sets about to inform others, he should have seen, not only
      the surface but the bottom of things; he should have had, not only a <i>vue
      d&rsquo;oiseau</i>, but (to use a celebrated naval commander&rsquo;s expression) a <i>vue
      de poisson</i> of his subject. By this time you must have heard enough of
      the Louvre and the Tuilleries, and Versailles, and le petit Trianon, and
      St. Cloud&mdash;and you have had enough of pictures and statues; and you
      know all that can be known of Bonaparté, by seeing him at a review or a
      levee; and the fashionable beauties and <i>celebrated characters</i> of
      the hour have all passed and repassed through the magic lantern. A fresh
      showman might make his figures a little more correct, or a little more in
      laughable caricature, but he could produce nothing new. Alas! there is
      nothing new under the sun. Nothing remains for the moderns, but to
      practise the oldest follies the newest ways. Would you, for the sake of
      your female friends, know the fashionable dress of a Parisian <i>elegante</i>,
      see Seneca on the transparent vestments of the Roman ladies, who, like
      these modern belles, were generous in the display of their charms to the
      public. No doubt these French republicanists act upon the true Spartan
      principle of modesty: they take the most efficacious method to prevent
      their influence from being too great over the imaginations of men, by
      renouncing all that insidious reserve which alone can render even beauty
      permanently dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the cruelties of the revolution I can tell you nothing new. The public
      have been steeped up to the lips in blood, and have surely had their fill
      of horrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, my dear friend, you say that I must be able to give a just view of
      the present state of French society, and of the best parts of it, because
      I have not, like some of my countrymen, hurried about Paris from one <i>spectacle</i>
      to another, seen the opera, and the play-houses, and the masked balls, and
      the gaming-houses, and the women of the Palais Royal, and the lions of all
      sorts; gone through the usual routine of presentation and public dinners,
      drunk French wine, damned French cookery, and &ldquo;come home content.&rdquo; I have
      certainly endeavoured to employ my time better, and have had the good
      fortune to be admitted into the best <i>private societies</i> in Paris.
      These were composed of the remains of the French nobility, of men of
      letters and science, and of families, who, without interfering in
      politics, devote themselves to domestic duties, to literary and social
      pleasures. The happy hours I have passed in this society can never be
      forgotten, and the kindness I have received has made its full impression
      upon an honest English heart. I will never disgrace the confidence of my
      friends, by drawing their characters for the public.

      OLIVIA TO MADAME DE P&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      L&mdash;&mdash; Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friendship, my amiable and interesting Gabrielle, is more an affair of the
      heart than of the head, more the instinct of taste than the choice of
      reason. With me the heart is no longer touched, when the imagination
      ceases to be charmed. Explain to me this metaphysical phenomenon of my
      nature, and, for your reward, I will quiet your jealousy, by confessing
      without compunction what now weighs on my conscience terribly. I begin to
      feel that I can never love this English friend as I ought. She is <i>too
      English</i>&mdash;far too English for one who has known the charms of
      French ease, vivacity, and sentiment; for one who has seen the bewitching
      Gabrielle&rsquo;s infinite variety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonora has just the figure and face that you would picture to yourself
      for <i>une belle Anglaise</i>; and if our Milton comes into your memory,
      you might repeat, for the quotation is not too trite for a foreigner,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Grace is in all her steps, heaven in her eye,
  In every gesture dignity and love.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But then it is grace which says nothing, a heaven only for a husband, the
      dignity more of a matron than of a heroine, and love that might have
      suited Eve before she had seen this world. Leonora is certainly a beauty;
      but then a beauty who does not know her power, and who, consequently, can
      make no one else feel its full extent. She is not unlike your beautiful
      Polish Princess, but she has none of the charming Anastasia&rsquo;s irresistible
      transitions from soft, silent languor, to brilliant, eloquent enthusiasm.
      All the gestures and attitudes of Anastasia are those of taste and
      sentiment; Leonora&rsquo;s are simply those of nature. <i>La belle nature</i>,
      but not <i>le beau idéal</i>. With a figure that would grace any court, or
      shine upon any stage, she usually enters a room without producing, or
      thinking of producing, any sensation; she moves often without seeming to
      have any other intention than to change her place; and her fine eyes
      generally look as if they were made only to see with. At times she
      certainly has a most expressive and intelligent countenance. I have seen
      her face enlightened by the fire of genius, and shaded by the exquisite
      touches of sensibility; but all this is merely called forth by the
      occasion, and vanishes before it is noticed by half the company. Indeed,
      the full radiance of her beauty or of her wit seldom shines upon any one
      but her husband. The audience and spectators are forgotten. Heavens! what
      a difference between the effect which Leonora and Gabrielle produce! But,
      to do her justice, much of this arises from the different <i>organization</i>
      of French and English society. In Paris the insipid details of domestic
      life are judiciously kept behind the scenes, and women appear as heroines
      upon the stage with all the advantages of decoration, to listen to the
      language of love, and to receive the homage of public admiration. In
      England, gallantry is not yet <i>systematized</i>, and our sex look more
      to their families than to what is called <i>society</i> for the happiness
      of existence. And yet the affection of mothers for their children does not
      appear to be so strong in the hearts of English as of French women. In
      England, ladies do not talk of the <i>sentiment of maternity</i> with that
      elegance and sensibility with which you expatiate upon it continually in
      conversation. They literally are <i>des bonnes mères de famille</i>, not
      from the impulse of sentiment, but merely from an early instilled sense of
      duty, for which they deserve little credit. However, they devote their
      lives to their children, and those who have the misfortune to be their
      intimate friends are doomed to see them half the day, or all day long, go
      through the part of the good mother in all its diurnal monotony of lessons
      and caresses. All this may be vastly right&mdash;it is a pity it is so
      tiresome. For my part I cannot conceive how persons of superior taste and
      talents can submit to it, unless it be to make themselves a reputation,
      and that you know is done by writing and talking on the general
      principles, not by submitting to the minute details of education. The
      great painter sketches the outline, and touches the principal features,
      but leaves the subordinate drudgery of filling up the parts, finishing the
      drapery, &amp;c., to inferior hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon recollection, in my favourite &ldquo;Sorrows of Werter,&rdquo; the heroine is
      represented cutting bread and butter for a group of children: I admire
      this simplicity in Goethe; &lsquo;tis one of the secrets by which he touches the
      heart. Simplicity is delightful by way of variety, but always simplicity
      is worse than <i>toujours perdrix</i>. Children in a novel or a drama are
      charming little creatures: but in real life they are often insufferable
      plagues. What becomes of them in Paris I know not; but I am sure that they
      are never in the way of one&rsquo;s conversations or reveries; and it would be a
      blessing to society if English children were as inaudible and invisible.
      These things strike me sensibly upon my return to England, after so long
      an absence. Surely, by means of the machinery of masters, and governesses,
      and schools, the manufacture of education might be carried on without
      incommoding those who desire to see only the finished production. Here I
      find the daughter of an English duke, a woman in the first bloom of youth,
      of the highest pretensions in point of rank, beauty, fashion,
      accomplishments, and talents, devoting herself to the education of two
      children, orphans, left to her care by an elder sister. To take charge of
      orphans is a good and fine action; as such it touches me sensibly; but
      then where is the necessity of sacrificing one&rsquo;s friends, and one&rsquo;s
      pleasures, day after day, and hour after hour, to mere children? Leonora
      can persevere only from a notion of duty. Now, in my opinion, when
      generosity becomes duty it ceases to be virtue. Virtue requires free-will:
      duty implies constraint. Virtue acts from the impulse of the moment, and
      never tires or is tired; duty drudges on in consequence of reflection,
      and, weary herself, wearies all beholders. Duty, always laborious, never
      can be graceful; and what is not graceful in woman cannot be amiable&mdash;can
      it, my amiable Gabrielle? But I reproach myself for all I have written.
      Leonora is my friend&mdash;besides, I am really obliged to her, and for
      the universe would I not hint a thought to her disadvantage. Indeed she is
      a most excellent, a faultless character, and it is the misfortune of your
      Olivia not to love perfection as she ought.
    </p>
    <p>
      My charming and interesting Gabrielle, I am more out of humour with myself
      than you can conceive; for in spite of all that reason and gratitude urge,
      I fear I cannot prefer the insipid virtues of Leonora to the lively graces
      of Gabrielle.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the cold husband, Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, I neither know nor wish to
      know any thing of him; but I live in hopes of an agreeable and interesting
      accession to our society to-day, from the arrival of Leonora&rsquo;s intimate
      friend, a young widow, whose husband I understand was a man of a harsh
      temper: she has gone through severe trials with surprising fortitude; and
      though I do not know her history, I am persuaded it must be interesting.
      Assuredly this husband could never have been the man of her choice, and of
      course she must have had some secret unhappy attachment, which doubtless
      preyed upon her spirits. Probably the object of her affection, in despair
      at her marriage, plighted his faith unfortunately, or possibly may have
      fallen a sacrifice to his constancy. I am all impatience to see her. Her
      husband&rsquo;s name was so ruggedly English, that I am sure you would never be
      able to pronounce it, especially if you only saw it written; therefore I
      shall always to you call her Helen, a name which is more pleasing to the
      ear, and more promising to the imagination. I have not been able to
      prevail upon Leonora to describe her friend to me exactly; she says only,
      that she loves Helen too well to overpraise her beforehand. My busy fancy
      has, however, bodied forth her form, and painted her in the most amiable
      and enchanting colours. Hark! she is just arrived. Adieu.

      LETTER XII.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      FROM MRS. C&mdash;&mdash; TO MISS B&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      . . . Having now had the honour of spending nearly a week in the society
      of the celebrated enchantress, Lady Olivia, you will naturally expect that
      I should be much improved in the art of love: but before I come to my
      improvements I must tell you, what will be rather more interesting, that
      Leonora is perfectly well and happy, and that I have the dear delight of
      exclaiming ten times an hour, &ldquo;Ay, just as I thought it would be!&mdash;Just
      such a wife, just such a mistress of a family I knew she would make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Not to admire</i>,&rdquo; is an art or a precept which I have not been able
      to practise much since I came here. Some philosophers tell us that
      admiration is not only a silly but a fatiguing state of mind; and I
      suppose that nothing could have preserved my mind from being tired to
      death, but the quantity of bodily exercise which I have taken. I could, if
      I pleased, give you a plan and elevation of this castle. Nay, I doubt not
      but I could stand an examination in the catalogue of the pictures, or the
      inventory of the furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      You, Helen!&mdash;you who could not remember the colour of Lady N&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s
      <i>new</i> curtains after you had seen them at least a hundred times!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady N&mdash;&mdash; was indifferent to me, and how could I hang up her
      curtains in my memory? By what could they hold? Do you not know, Margaret
      ... all the fine things that I could say, and that quartos have said
      before me, about the association of ideas and sensations, &amp;c.? Those
      we love impart to uninteresting objects the power of pleasing, as the
      magnet can communicate to inert metal its attractive influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; was Leonora&rsquo;s lover I never liked him much. I do
      not mean to call him inert. I always knew that he had many excellent
      qualities; but there was nothing in his temper peculiarly agreeable to me,
      and there was something in his character that I did not thoroughly
      understand; yet, since he is become Leonora&rsquo;s husband, I find my
      understanding much improved, and I dare say it will soon be so far
      enlarged, that I shall comprehend him perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonora has almost persuaded me to like Lady Olivia. Not to laugh at her
      would be impossible. I wish you could see the way in which we go on
      together. Our first setting out would have diverted you. Enter Lady Olivia
      breathless, with an air of theatric expectation&mdash;advances to embrace
      Helen, who is laughing with Leonora&mdash;her back turned towards the side
      of the stage at which Olivia enters&mdash;Olivia pauses suddenly, and
      measures Helen <i>with a long look</i>. What passes in Lady Olivia&rsquo;s mind
      at this moment I do not know, but I guess that she was disappointed
      woefully by my appearance. After some time she was recovered, by Leonora&rsquo;s
      assistance, from her reverie, and presently began to admire my vivacity,
      and to find out that I was Clarissa&rsquo;s Miss Howe&mdash;no, I was Lady G.&mdash;no,
      I was Heloise&rsquo;s Clara: but I, choosing to be myself, and insisting upon
      being an <i>original</i>, sunk again visibly and rapidly in Olivia&rsquo;s
      opinion, till I was in imminent danger of being <i>nobody</i>, Leonora
      again kindly interposed to save me from annihilation; and after an
      interval of an hour or two dedicated to letter-writing, Lady Olivia
      returned and seated herself beside me, resolved to decide what manner of
      woman I was. Certain novels are the touchstones of feeling and <i>intellect</i>
      with certain ladies. Unluckily I was not well read in these; and in the
      questions put to me from these sentimental statute-books, I gave strange
      judgments, often for the husband or parents against the heroine. I did not
      even admit the plea of destiny, irresistible passion, or <i>entraînement</i>,
      as in all cases sufficient excuse for all errors and crimes. Moreover, I
      excited astonishment by calling things by obsolete names. I called a
      married woman&rsquo;s having a lover <i>a crime</i>! Then I was no judge of
      virtues, for I thought a wife&rsquo;s making an intimate friend of her husband&rsquo;s
      mistress was scandalous and mean; but this I was told is the height of
      delicacy and generosity. I could not perceive the propriety of a man&rsquo;s
      liking two women at the same time, or a woman&rsquo;s having a platonic
      attachment for half a dozen lovers: and I owned that I did not wish
      divorce could be as easily obtained in England as in France. All which
      proved that I have never been out of England&mdash;a great misfortune! I
      dare say it will soon be discovered that women as well as madeira cannot
      be good for any thing till they have crossed the line. But besides the
      obloquy of having lived only in the best company in England, I was further
      disgraced by the discovery, that I am deplorably ignorant of metaphysics,
      and have never been enlightened by any philanthropic transcendental
      foreign professor of humanity. Profoundly humiliated, and not having yet
      taken the first step towards knowledge, the knowing that I was ignorant, I
      was pondering upon my sad fate, when Lady Olivia, putting her hand upon my
      shoulder, summoned me into the court of love, there in my own proper
      person to answer such questions as it should please her ladyship to ask.
      For instance:&mdash;&ldquo;Were you ever in love?&mdash;How often?&mdash;When?&mdash;Where?&mdash;And
      with whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never having stood a cross-examination in public upon these points, I was
      not quite prepared to reply; and I was accused of giving evasive answers,
      and convicted of blushing. Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, who was present at this
      examination, enjoyed, in his grave way, my astonishment and confusion, but
      said not one word. I rallied my spirits and my wits, and gave some answers
      which gained the smile of the court on my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these specimens you may guess, my dear Margaret, how well this lady
      and I are likely to agree. I shall divert myself with her absurdities
      without scruple. Yet notwithstanding the flagrancy of these, Leonora
      persuades me to think well of Olivia; indeed I am so happy here, that it
      would be a difficult matter at present to make me think ill of any body.
      The good qualities, which Leonora sees in her, are not yet visible to my
      eyes; but Leonora&rsquo;s visual orb is so cleared with charity and love, that
      she can discern what is not revealed to vulgar sight. Even in the very
      germ, she discovers the minute form of the perfect flower. <i>The Olivia</i>
      will, I hope, in time, blow out in full perfection.

    <h3>
      OLIVIA TO MADAME DE P&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
      O my Gabrielle! this Helen is not precisely the person that I expected.
      Instead of being a dejected beauty, she is all life and gaiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      I own I should like her better if she were a little more pensive; a tinge
      of melancholy would, in her situation, be so becoming and natural. My
      imagination was quite disappointed when I beheld the quickness of her eyes
      and frequency of her smiles. Even her mode of showing affection to Leonora
      was not such as could please me. This is the first visit, I understand,
      that she has paid Leonora since her marriage: these friends have been
      separated for many months.&mdash;I was not present at their meeting; but I
      came into the room a few minutes after <i>Helen</i>&rsquo;s arrival, and I
      should have thought that they had seen one another but yesterday. This <i>dear
      Helen</i> was quite at ease and at home in a few moments, and seemed as if
      she had been living with us for years. I make allowance for the ease of
      well-bred people. Helen has lived much in the world, and has polished
      manners. But the heart&mdash;the heart is superior to politeness; and even
      ease, in some situations, shows a want of the delicate <i>tact</i> of
      sentiment. In a similar situation I should have been silent, entranced,
      absorbed in my sensations&mdash;overcome by them, perhaps dissolved in
      tears. But in Helen there appeared no symptoms of real sensibility&mdash;nothing
      characteristic&mdash;nothing profound&mdash;nothing concentrated: it was
      all superficial, and evaporated in the common way. I was provoked to see
      Leonora satisfied. She assures me that Helen has uncommonly strong
      affections, and that her character rather exceeds than is deficient in
      enthusiasm. Possibly; but I am certain that Helen is in no danger of
      becoming romantic. Far from being abstracted, I never saw any one seem
      more interested and eager about every present occurrence&mdash;pleased,
      even to childishness, with every passing trifle. I confess that she is too
      much of this world for me. But I will if possible suspend my judgment, and
      study her a few hours longer, before I give you my definitive opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thursday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, my Gabrielle, my <i>definitive opinion</i> is that I can never love
      this friend of Leonora. I said that she had lived much in the world&mdash;but
      only in the English world: she has never seen any other; therefore, though
      quite in a different style from Leonora, she shocks me with the same
      nationality. All her ideas are exclusively English: she has what is called
      English good sense, and English humour, and English prejudices of <i>all
      sorts</i>, both masculine and feminine. She takes fire in defence of her
      country and of her sex; nay, sometimes blushes even to awkwardness, which
      one would not expect in the midst of her good breeding and vivacity. What
      a difference between her vivacity and that of my charming Gabrielle! as
      great as between the enlargement of your mind and the limited nature of
      her understanding. I tried her on various subjects, but found her
      intrenched in her own contracted notions. All new, or liberal, or sublime
      ideas in morality or metaphysics she either cannot seize, or seizes only
      to place in a ridiculous point of view: a certain sign of mediocrity.
      Adieu, my Gabrielle. I must send you the pictures, whether engaging or
      forbidding, of those with whom your Olivia is destined to pass her time.
      When I have no events to relate, still I must write to convey to you my
      sentiments. Alas! how imperfectly!&mdash;for I have interdicted myself the
      expression of those most interesting to my heart. Leonora, calmly prudent,
      coolly virtuous, knows not what it costs me to be faithful to this cruel
      promise. Write to me, my sympathizing, my tender friend!

    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p>
      July 10th.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some very good people, like some very fine pictures, are best at a
      distance. But Leonora is not one of these: the nearer you approach, the
      better you like her; as in arabesque-work you may admire the beauty of the
      design even at a distance, but you cannot appreciate the delicacy of the
      execution till you examine it closely, and discover that every line is
      formed of grains of gold, almost imperceptibly fine. I am glad that the
      &ldquo;small sweet courtesies of life&rdquo; have been hailed by one sentimental
      writer at least. The minor virtues are not to be despised, even in
      comparison with the most exalted. The common rose, I have often thought,
      need not be ashamed of itself even in company with the finest exotics in a
      hothouse; and I remember, that your brother, in one of his letters,
      observed, that the common cock makes a very respectable figure, even in
      the grand Parisian assembly of all the stuffed birds and beasts in the
      universe. It is a glorious thing to have a friend who will jump into a
      river, or down a precipice, to save one&rsquo;s life: but as I do not intend to
      tumble down precipices, or to throw myself into the water above half a
      dozen times, I would rather have for my friends persons who would not
      reserve their kindness wholly for these grand occasions, but who could
      condescend to make me happy every day, and all day long, even by actions
      not sufficiently sublime to be recorded in history or romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not infer from this that I think Leonora would hesitate to make <i>great</i>
      sacrifices. I have had sufficient experience of her fortitude and active
      courage of mind in the most trying circumstances, whilst many who talked
      more stoutly, shrunk from <i>committing</i> themselves by actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some maxim-maker says, that past misfortunes are good for nothing but to
      be forgotten. I am not of his opinion: I think that they are good to make
      us know our winter from our summer friends, and to make us feel for those
      who have sustained us in adversity, that most pleasurable sensation of the
      human mind&mdash;gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I am straying unawares into the province of sentiment, where I am such
      a stranger that I shall inevitably lose my way, especially as I am too
      proud to take a guide. Lady Olivia &mdash;&mdash; may perhaps be very fond
      of Leonora: and as she has every possible cause to be so, it is but
      reasonable and charitable to suppose that she is: but I should never guess
      it by her manner. She speaks of her friendship sometimes in the most
      romantic style, but often makes observations upon <i>the enviable coolness
      and imperturbability of Leonora&rsquo;s disposition</i>, which convinces me that
      she does not understand it in the least. Those who do not really feel,
      always pitch their expressions too high or too low, as deaf people bellow,
      or speak in a whisper. But I may be mistaken in my suspicions of Olivia;
      for <i>to do the lady justice</i>, as Mrs. Candour would say, she is so
      affected, that it is difficult to know what she really feels. Those who
      put on rouge occasionally, are suspected of wearing it constantly, and
      never have any credit for their natural colour; presently they become so
      accustomed to common rouge, that, mistaking scarlet for pale pink, they
      persist in laying on more and more, till they are like nothing human.

    </h3>
    <p>
      I have found it! I have found it! dear Gabrielle, rejoice with me! I have
      solved the metaphysical problem, which perplexed me so cruelly, and now I
      am once more at peace with myself. I have discovered the reason why I
      cannot love Leonora as she merits to be loved&mdash;she has obliged me;
      and the nature of obligation is such, that it supposes superiority on one
      side, and consequently destroys the equality, the freedom, the ease, the
      charm of friendship. Gratitude weighs upon one&rsquo;s heart in proportion to
      the delicacy of its feelings. To minds of an ordinary sort it may be
      pleasurable, for with them it is sufficiently feeble to be calm; but in
      souls of a superior cast, it is a poignant, painful sensation, because it
      is too strong ever to be tranquil. In short,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis bliss but to a certain bound&mdash;
   Beyond, &lsquo;tis agony.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      For my own part, the very dread that I shall not be thought to express
      enough, deprives me of the power to speak or even to feel. Fear, you know,
      extinguishes affection; and of all fears, the dread of not being
      sufficiently grateful, operates the most powerfully. Thus sensibility
      destroys itself.&mdash;Gracious Heaven! teach me to moderate mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the nature of the obligation with which Leonora has oppressed my heart,
      there is something peculiarly humiliating. Upon my return to this country,
      I found the malignant genius of scandal bent upon destroying my
      reputation. You have no idea of the miserable force of prejudice which
      still prevails here. There are some women who emancipate themselves, but
      then unluckily they are not in sufficient numbers to keep each other in
      countenance in public. One would not choose to be confined to the society
      of people who cannot go to court, though sometimes they take the lead
      elsewhere. We are full half a century behind you in civilization; and your
      revolution has, I find, afforded all our stiffened moralists <i>incontrovertible</i>
      arguments against liberty of opinion or conduct in either sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was thunderstruck when I saw the grave and repulsive faces of all my
      female acquaintance. At first I attributed every thing that was strange
      and disagreeable to English reserve, of which I had retained a
      sufficiently formidable idea: but I presently found that there was some
      other cause which kept all these nice consciences at a distance from my
      atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you believe it? I saw myself upon the point of being quite excluded
      from good society. Leonora saved me from this imminent danger.
      Voluntarily, and I must say nobly, if not gracefully, Leonora came forward
      in my defence. Vanquishing her natural English timidity, she braved the
      eyes, and tongues, and advice of all the prudes and old dowagers my
      enemies, amongst whom I may count the superannuated Duchess her mother,
      the proudest dowager now living. When I appeared in public with a
      personage of Leonora&rsquo;s unblemished reputation, scandal, much against her
      will, was forced to be silent, and it was to be taken for granted that I
      was, in the language of prudery, perfectly innocent. Leonora, to be
      consistent in goodness, or to complete her triumph in the face of the
      world, invited me to accompany her to the country.&mdash;I have now been
      some weeks at this superb castle. Heaven is my witness that I came with a
      heart overflowing with affection; but the painful, the agonizing sense of
      humiliation mixed with my tenderest sentiments, and all became bitterness
      insufferable. Oh, Gabrielle! you, and perhaps you alone upon earth, can
      understand my feelings. Adieu!&mdash;pity me&mdash;I must not ask you a
      single question about&mdash;I must not write the name for ever dear&mdash;What
      am I saying? where are my promises?&mdash;Adieu!&mdash;Adieu!

      As I have never thought it my duty in this mortal life to mourn for the
      absurdities of my fellow-creatures, I should now enjoy the pleasure of
      laughing at Lady Olivia, if my propensity were not checked by a serious
      apprehension that she will injure Leonora&rsquo;s happiness. From the most
      generous motives, dear Leonora is continually anxious to soothe her mind,
      to persuade and reason her into common sense, to re-establish her in
      public opinion, and to make her happy. But I am convinced that Lady Olivia
      never will have common sense, and consequently never can be happy. Twenty
      times a day I wish her at the antipodes, for I dread lest Leonora should
      be implicated in her affairs, and involved in her misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last night this foolish woman, who unluckily is graced with all the power
      of words, poured forth a fine declamation in favour of divorce. In vain
      Leonora reasoned, expostulated, blushed. Lady Olivia cannot blush for
      herself; and though both Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; and I were present, she
      persisted with that vehemence which betrays personal interest in an
      argument. I suspect that she is going to try to obtain a divorce from her
      husband, that she may marry her lover. Consider the consequences of this
      for Leonora.&mdash;Leonora to be the friend of a woman who will risk the
      infamy of a trial at Doctors&rsquo; Commons! But Leonora says I am mistaken, and
      that all this is only Olivia&rsquo;s way of talking. I wish then, that, if she
      does not intend to act like a fool, she would not talk like one. I agree
      with the gentleman who said that a woman who begins by playing the fool,
      always ends by playing the devil. Even before me, though I certainly never
      solicit her confidence, Lady Olivia talks with the most imprudent openness
      of her love affairs; not, I think, from ingenuousness, but from inability
      to restrain herself. Begin what subject of conversation I will, as far
      from Cupid as possible, she will bring me back again to him before I know
      where I am. She has no ideas but on this one subject. Leonora, dear,
      kind-hearted Leonora, attributes this to the temporary influence of a
      violent passion, which she assures me Olivia will conquer, and that then
      all her great and good qualities will, as if freed from enchantment,
      re-assume their natural vigour. <i>Natural!</i>&mdash;there is nothing
      natural about this sophisticated lady. I wish Leonora would think more of
      herself, and less of other people. As to Lady Olivia&rsquo;s excessive
      sensibility, I have no faith in it. I do not think either the lover or the
      passion so much to be feared for her, as the want of a lover and the habit
      of thinking that it is necessary to be in love. . . .

      When you ask a countryman in England the way to the next town, he replies,

      you will take hearsay evidence, and if you wish me to speak to general
      character, I can readily satisfy you. Common reputed, loud and unanimous
      in favour of her talents, beauty, and fashion: there is no resisting, I am
      told, the fascination of her manners and conversation; <i>but</i> her
      opinions are fashionably liberal, and her practice as liberal as her
      theories. Since her separation from her husband, her lover is publicly
      named. Some English friends plead in her favour platonic attachment: this,
      like benefit of clergy, is claimed of course for a first offence: but Lady
      Olivia&rsquo;s Parisian acquaintance are not so scrupulous or so old-fashioned
      as to think it an offence; they call it an <i>arrangement</i>, and to this
      there can be no objection. As a French gentleman said to me the other day,
      with an unanswerable shrug, &ldquo;Tout le monde sait que R&mdash;&mdash; est
      son amant; d&rsquo;ailleurs, c&rsquo;est la femme la plus aimable du monde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As to Lady Olivia&rsquo;s friend, Mad. de P&mdash;&mdash;, she sees a great deal
      of company: her house is the resort of people of various descriptions;
      ministers, foreigners, coquettes, and generals; in short, of all those who
      wish, without scandal or suspicion, to intrigue either in love or
      politics. Her assemblies are also frequented by a few of <i>l&rsquo;ancien
      régime</i>, who wish to be in favour with the present government. Mad. de
      P&mdash;&mdash;, of a noble family herself, and formerly much at court,
      has managed matters so as to have regained all her husband&rsquo;s confiscated
      property, and to have acquired much influence with some of the leading men
      of the day. In her manners and conversation there is an odd mixture of
      frivolity and address, of the airs of coquetry and the jargon of
      sentiment. She has the politeness of a French Countess, with <i>exquisite</i>
      knowledge of the world and of <i>les convenances</i>, joined to that
      freedom of opinion which marks the present times. In the midst of all
      these inconsistencies, it is difficult to guess what her real character
      may be. At first sight I should pronounce her to be a silly woman,
      governed by vanity and the whim of the moment: but those who know her
      better than I do, believe her to be a woman of considerable talents,
      inordinately fond of power, and uniformly intent upon her own interest,
      using coquetry only as a means to govern our sex, and frivolity as a mask
      for her ambition. In short, Mad. de P&mdash;&mdash; is a perfect specimen
      of the combination of an <i>intrigante</i> and an <i>élégante</i>, a
      combination often found in Paris. Here women mingle politics and gallantry&mdash;men
      mix politics and epicurism&mdash;which is the better mixture?
    </p>
    <p>
      I have business of importance to my country to transact to-day, <i>therefore</i>
      I am going to dine with the modern Apicius. Excuse me, my dear friend, if
      I cannot stay at present to answer your questions about divorce. I must be
      punctual. What sort of a negotiator can he make who is too late at a
      minister&rsquo;s dinner? Five minutes might change the face of Europe.

    <h3>
      MADAME DE P&mdash;&mdash; TO OLIVIA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      My incomparable Olivia! your letters are absolutely divine. I am <i>maussade</i>,
      I <i>vegetate</i>. I cannot be said to live the days when I do not hear
      from you. Last Thursday I was disappointed of one of these dear letters,
      and <i>Brave-et-tendre</i> told me frankly, that I was so little amiable
      he should not have known me.&mdash;As to the rest, pardon me for not
      writing punctually: I have been really in a chaos of business and
      pleasure, and I do not know which fatigues most. But I am obliged to
      attend the ministers every day, for the sake of my friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand and a thousand thanks for your pictures of your English
      friends: sketches by a masterly hand must be valuable, whatever the
      subject. I would rather have the pictures than the realities. Your Helen
      and your Lady Leonora are too good for me, and I pity you from my soul for
      being shut up in that old castle. I suppose it is like an old castle in
      Dauphiny, where I once spent a week, and where I was nearly frightened to
      death by the flapping of the old tapestry behind my bed, and by the bats
      which flew in through the broken windows. They say, however, that our <i>châteaux</i>
      and yours are something different. Of this I have no clear conception.
    </p>
    <p>
      I send you three comforters in your prison&mdash;a billet-doux, a new
      novel, and a pattern of my sandal: a billet-doux from R&mdash;&mdash; says
      every thing for itself; but I must say something for the new novel.
      Zenobie, which I now send you, is the declared rival of Seraphin. Parties
      have run high on both sides, and applications were made and inuendoes
      discovered, and wit and sentiment came to close combat; and, as usual,
      people talked till they did not understand themselves. For a fortnight,
      wherever one went, the first words to be heard on entering every <i>salon</i>
      were Seraphine and Zenobie.&mdash;Peace or war.&mdash;Mlle. Georges and
      Mlle. Duchesnois were nothing to Seraphine and Zenobie. For Heaven&rsquo;s sake
      tell me which you prefer! But I fear they will be no more talked of before
      I have your answer. To say the truth, I am tired of both heroines, for a
      fortnight is too long to talk or think of any one thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I flatter myself you will like my sandals: they are my own invention, and
      my foot really shows them to advantage. You know I might say, as Du P&mdash;&mdash;said
      of himself, &ldquo;J&rsquo;ai un pied dont la petitesse échappe à la vitesse de la
      pensée.&rdquo; I thought my poor friend Mad. Dumarais would have died with envy,
      the other day, when I appeared in them at her ball, which, by-the-bye, was
      in all its decorations as absurd and in as bad taste as usual. For the
      most part these <i>nouveaux riches</i> lavish money, but can never
      purchase taste or a sense of propriety. All is gold: but that is not
      enough; or rather that is too much. In spite of all that both the Indies,
      China, Arabia, Egypt, and even Paris can do for them, they will be ever
      out of place, in the midst of their magnificence: they will never even
      know how to ruin themselves nobly. They must live and die as they were
      born, ridiculous. Now I would rather not exist than feel myself
      ridiculous. But I believe no one living, not even le petit d&rsquo;Heronville,
      knows himself to be an object of ridicule. There are no looking-glasses
      for the mind, and I question whether we should use them if there were.
      D&rsquo;Heronville is just as you left him, and as much my amusement as he used
      to be yours. He goes on with an eternal galimatias of patriotism, with
      such a self-sufficient air and decided tone! never suspecting that he says
      only what other people make him say, and that he is listened to, only to
      find out what <i>some people</i> think. Many will say before fools, what
      they would not hazard before wise men; not considering that fools can
      repeat as well as parrots. I once heard a great man remark, that the only
      spies fit to be trusted are those who do not know themselves to be such;
      who have no salary but what their vanity pays them, and who are employed
      without being accredited.
    </p>
    <p>
      But trève de politique!&mdash;My charming Olivia, I know, abhors politics,
      as much as I detest metaphysics, from all lips or pens but hers. Now I
      must tell you something of your friends here.
    </p>
    <p>
      O&mdash;&mdash; talks nonsense as agreeably as ever, and dances as
      divinely. &lsquo;Tis a pity he cannot always dance, for then he would not ruin
      himself at play. He wants me to get him a regiment&mdash;as if I had any
      power!&mdash;or as if I would use it for this purpose, when I knew that my
      interesting friend Mad. Q&mdash;&mdash;would break her poor little heart
      if he were to quit her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mon Coeur</i> is as pretty as ever; but she is now in affliction. She
      has lost her dear little dog Corisonde. He died suddenly; almost in her
      arms! She will erect a monument to him in her charming <i>jardin Anglois</i>.
      This will occupy her, and then &ldquo;Time, the comforter&rdquo;&mdash;Inimitable
      Voltaire!
    </p>
    <p>
      Our dear <i>Brillante</i> has just had a superb <i>hommage</i> from her
      lover the commissary&mdash;a necklace and bracelets of the finest; pearls:
      but she cannot wear them yet: her brother having died last week, she is in
      deep mourning. This brother was not upon good terms with her. He never
      forgave the divorce. He thought it a disgrace to have a sister <i>une
      divorcée</i>; but he was full of prejudice, poor man, and he is dead, and
      we need think no more of him or of his faults.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our ci-devant chanoine, who married that little Meudon, is as miserable as
      possible, and as ridiculous: for he is jealous of his young wife, and she
      is a <i>franche-coquette</i>. The poor man looks as if he repented
      sincerely of his errors. What a penitent a coquette can make of a husband!
      Bourdaloue and Massillon would have tried their powers on this man&rsquo;s heart
      in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did I tell you that Mad. G&mdash;&mdash; is a second time divorced? But
      this time it is her husband&rsquo;s doing, not hers. This handsome husband has
      spent all the immense fortune she brought him, and now procures a divorce
      for <i>incompatibility of temper</i>, and is going to marry another lady,
      richer than Mad. G&mdash;&mdash;, and as great a fool. This system of
      divorce, though convenient, is not always advantageous to women. However,
      in one point of view, I wonder that the rigid moralists do not defend it,
      as the only means of making a man in love with his own wife. A man
      divorces; the law does not permit him to marry the same woman afterwards;
      of course this prohibition makes him fall in love with her. Of this we
      have many edifying examples besides Fanchette, who, though she was so
      beautiful, and a tolerable actress, would never have drawn all Paris to
      the Vaudeville if she had not been a <i>divorcée</i>, and if it had not
      been known that her husband, who played the lover of the piece, was dying
      to marry her again. Apropos, Mad. St. Germain is acting one of her own
      romances, in the high sublime style, and threatens to poison herself for
      love of her perjured inconstant&mdash;but it will not do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame <i>la Grande</i> was near having a sad accident the other night: in
      crossing the Pont-neuf her horses took fright; for there was a crowd and
      <i>embarras</i>, a man having just drowned himself&mdash;not for love, but
      for hunger. How many men, women, and children, do you think drowned
      themselves in the Seine last year? Upwards of two hundred. This is really
      shocking, and a stop should be put to it by authority. It absolutely makes
      me shudder and reflect; but <i>après nous le déluge</i> was La Pompadour&rsquo;s
      maxim, and should be ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mad. Folard <i>se coiffe en cheveux</i>, and Mad. Rocroix crowns herself
      with roses, whilst all the world knows that either of them is old enough
      to be my mother. In former days a woman could not wear flowers after
      thirty, and was <i>bel esprit</i> or <i>dévote</i> at forty, for it was
      thought bad taste to do otherwise. But now every body may be as young as
      they please, or as ridiculous. Women have certainly gained by the new
      order of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our poor friend <i>Vermeille</i> se meurt de la poitrine&mdash;a victim to
      tea and late hours. She is an interesting creature, and my heart bleeds
      for her: she will never last till winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you know, it is said, we shall soon have no wood to burn. What can have
      become of all our forests? People should inquire after them. The Venus de
      Medici has at last found her way down the Seine. It is not determined yet
      where to place her: but she is at Paris, and that is a great point gained
      for her. You complained that the Apollo stands with his back so near the
      wall, that there is no seeing half the beauties of his shoulders. If I
      have any influence, Venus shall not be so served. I have been to see her.
      She is certainly divine&mdash;but not French. I do not despair of seeing
      her surpassed by our artists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adieu, my adorable Olivia. I should have finished my letter yesterday; but
      when I came home in the morning, expecting to have a moment sacred to you
      and friendship, whom should I find established in an arm-chair in my
      cabinet but our old Countess <i>Cidevant</i>. There was no retreat for me.
      In the midst of my concentrated rage, I was obliged to advance and embrace
      her, and there was an end of happiness for the day. The pitiless woman
      kept me till it was even too late to dress, talking over her family
      misfortunes; as if they were any thing to me. She wants to get her son
      employed, but her pride will not let her pay her court properly, and she
      wants me to do it for her. Not I, truly. I should shut my doors against
      her but for the sake of her nephew <i>le roué</i>, who is really a pretty
      young man. My angel, I embrace you tenderly.

      LETTER XIX.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      OLIVIA TO MADAME DE P&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      How melancholy to a feeling heart is the moment when illusion vanishes,
      whether that illusion has been created by the magic of love or of
      friendship! How many such moments, Gabrielle, has your unfortunate friend
      been doomed to endure! Alas! when will treacherous fancy cease to throw a
      deceitful brilliancy upon each new object!
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps I am too delicate&mdash;but R&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s note, enclosed in
      your last, my Gabrielle, was unlike his former letters. It was not
      passionate, it was only reasonable. A man who can reason is no longer in
      love. The manner in which he speaks of divorce shocked me beyond
      expression. Is it for him to talk of scruples when upon this subject I
      have none? I own to you that my pride and my tenderness are sensibly
      wounded. Is it for him to convince me that I am in the wrong? I shall not
      be at ease till I hear from you again, my amiable friend: for my residence
      here becomes insupportable. But a few short weeks are past since I fancied
      Leonora an angel, and now she falls below the ordinary standard of
      mortals. But a few short weeks are past since, in the full confidence of
      finding in Leonora a second self, a second Gabrielle, I eagerly developed
      to her my inmost soul; yet now my heart closes, I fear never more to open.
      The sad conviction, that we have but few ideas, and no feelings in common,
      stops my tongue when I attempt to speak, chills my heart when I begin to
      listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you know, my Gabrielle, I have discovered that Leonora is inordinately
      selfish? For all other faults I have charity; but selfishness, which has
      none to give, must expect none. O divine sensibility, defend me from this
      isolation of the heart! All thy nameless sorrows, all thy heart-rending
      tortures, would I a thousand times rather endure. Leonora&rsquo;s selfishness
      breaks out perpetually; and, alas! it is of the most inveterate, incurable
      kind: every thing that is immediately or remotely connected with self she
      loves, and loves with the most provoking pertinacity. Her mother, her
      husband, she adores, because they are her own; and even her sister&rsquo;s
      children, because she considers them, she says, as her own. All and every
      possible portion of self she cherishes with the most sordid partiality.
      All that touches these relations touches her; and every thing which is
      theirs, or, in other words, which is hers, she deems excellent and sacred.
      Last night I just hazarded a word of ridicule upon some of the obsolete
      prejudices of that august personage, that Duchess of old tapestry, her
      still living ancestor. I wish, Gabrielle, you had seen Leonora&rsquo;s
      countenance. Her colour rose up to her temples, her eyes lightened with
      indignation, and her whole person assumed a dignity, which might have
      killed a presumptuous lover, or better far, might have enslaved him for
      life. What folly to waste all this upon such an occasion! But selfishness
      is ever blind to its real interests. Leonora is so bigoted to this old
      woman, that she is already in mind an old woman herself. She fancies that
      she traces a resemblance to her mother, and of course to dear self in her
      infant, and she looks upon it with such doting eyes, and talks to it with
      such exquisite tones of fondness, as are to me, who know the source from
      which they proceed, quite ridiculous and disgusting. An infant, who has no
      imaginable merit, and, to impartial eyes, no charms, she can love to this
      excess from no motive but pure <i>egotism</i>. Then her husband&mdash;but
      this subject I must reserve for another letter. I am summoned to walk with
      him this moment.

    <h3>
      GENERAL B&mdash;&mdash; TO MR. L&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      MY DEAR L&mdash;&mdash;, Paris, 180&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enclosed I send you, according to your earnest desire, Cambacérès&rsquo; 
      reflections upon the intended new law of divorce. Give me leave to ask why
      you are so violently interested upon this occasion? Do you envy France
      this blessing? Do you wish that English husbands and wives should have the
      power of divorcing each other at pleasure for <i>incompatibility of temper</i>?
      And have you calculated the admirable effect this would produce upon the
      temper both of the weaker and the stronger sex? To bear and forbear would
      then be no longer necessary. Every happy pair might quarrel and part at a
      moment&rsquo;s notice&mdash;at a year&rsquo;s notice at most. And their children? The
      wisdom of Solomon would be necessary to settle the just division of the
      children. I have this morning been attending a court of law to hear a
      famous trial between two husbands: the abdicated lord a ci-devant noble,
      and the reigning husband a ci-devant grand-vicaire, who has <i>reformed</i>.
      Each party claimed a right to the children by the first marriage, for the
      children were minors entitled to large fortunes. The <i>reformed</i>
      grand-vicaire pleaded his own cause with astonishing assurance, amidst the
      discountenancing looks, murmurs, and almost amidst the groans of
      disapprobation from the majority of the auditors. His powers of impudence,
      however, failed him at last. I sat on the bench behind him, and saw that
      his ears had the grace to blush. After another hearing, this cause, which
      had lasted four years, was decided; and the first husband and real father
      was permitted to have the guardianship of his own children. During the
      four years&rsquo; litigation, the friends of the parties, from the grandmother
      downwards, were all at irreconcileable variance. What became of the
      children all this time? Their mother was represented during the trial as
      she deserved to be, as a wretch void of shame and gratitude. The father
      was universally pitied, though his rival painted him as a coward, who
      during the revolution had left his children to save himself by flight; and
      as a fool, who had left his wife to the care of a profligate
      grand-vicaire. Divorce is not countenanced by opinion in Paris, though
      permitted by law. With a few exceptions in extraordinary cases, I have
      observed that <i>les divorcées</i> are not received into good society.
    </p>
    <p>
      To satiate your curiosity, I send you all the papers that have been
      written lately on this subject, of which you will find that of Cambacérès
      the best. The wits say that he is an impartial judge. I presume you want
      these pamphlets for some foolish friend; for yourself you can never want
      them, blessed as you are with such a wife as Lady Leonora L&mdash;. I am
      not surprised that profligate men should wish for freedom of divorce,
      because it would save them damages in Doctors&rsquo; Commons: but you rather
      astonish me&mdash;if a wise man should be astonished at any thing in these
      days&mdash;by assuring me that you have lately heard this system
      eloquently defended by a female philosopher. What can women expect from it
      but contempt? Next to polygamy, it would prove the most certain method of
      destroying the domestic happiness of the sex, as well as their influence
      and respectability in society. But some of the dear creatures love to talk
      of what they do not understand, and usually show their eloquence to the
      greatest advantage, by taking the wrong side of a question.

    <p>
      From selfishness to jealousy there is but one step, or rather there is
      none; for jealousy of a certain sort is but selfishness in another form.
      How different this passion as I have felt it, and as I see it shown! In
      some characters it is the symptom of amiable and exquisite sensibility; in
      others of odious coldness and contraction of heart. In some of our sex it
      is, you know, my Gabrielle, a delicate fear, a tender anxiety, a proof of
      ardent passion; in others it is a mere love of power, a disgusting
      struggle for the property of a heart, an absurd assertion of rights and
      prerogatives. Surely no prejudice of education or institution can be more
      barbarous than that which teaches a wife that she has an indefeasible and
      exclusive right both to the affections and the fidelity of her husband. I
      am astonished to hear it avowed by any woman who has the slightest
      pretensions to delicacy of sentiment, or liberality of mind. I should
      expect to find this vulgar prejudice only among the downright dames, who
      talk of <i>my good man</i>, and lay a particular emphasis on the
      possessive pronoun <i>my</i>; who understand literally, and expect that
      their spouses should adhere punctually to every coarse article of our
      strange marriage vow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In certain points of view, my Gabrielle, jealousy is undoubtedly the
      strongest proof of an indelicate mind. Yet, if I mistake not, the
      delicate, the divine Leonora, is liable to this terrestrial passion.
      Yesterday evening, as I was returning from a <i>stroll</i> in the park
      with Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, we met Leonora; and methought she looked
      embarrassed at meeting us. Heaven knows there was not the slightest
      occasion for embarrassment, and I could not avoid being surprised at such
      weakness, I had almost said folly, in a woman of Leonora&rsquo;s sense,
      especially as she knows how my heart is attached. In the first moments of
      our intimacy my confidence was unbounded, as it ever is in those I love.
      Aware as I was of the light in which the prejudices of her education and
      her country make her view such connexions, yet I scrupled not, with the
      utmost candour, to confess the unfortunate attachment which had ruled my
      destiny. After this confidence, do not suspicion and jealousy on her part
      appear strange? Were Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; and I shut up for life in the
      same prison, were we left together upon a desert island, were we alone in
      the universe, I could never think of him. And Leonora does not see this!
      How the passions obscure and degrade the finest understandings! But
      perhaps I do her injustice, and she felt nothing of what her countenance
      expressed. It is certain, however, that she was silent for some moments
      after she joined us, from what cause she knows best&mdash;so was Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;,
      I suppose from English awkwardness&mdash;so was I, from pure astonishment.
      At length, in pity of Leonora, I broke the silence. I had recourse to the
      beauties of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a heavenly evening!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;We have been listening to the songs of
      the birds, enjoying this fresh breeze of nature&rsquo;s perfumes.&rdquo; Leonora said
      something about the superiority of nature&rsquo;s perfumes to those of art; and
      observed, &ldquo;how much more agreeable the smell of flowers appears in the
      open air than in confined rooms!&rdquo; Whilst she spoke she looked at her
      husband, as she continually does for assent and approbation. He assented,
      but apparently without knowing what he was saying; and only by one of his
      English monosyllables. I alone was at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can any thing be more beautiful,&rdquo; continued I, looking back, &ldquo;than the
      soft mellow foliage of those woods, and the exquisite tints of their rich
      colouring? What delicious melancholy such an evening spreads over the
      heart!&mdash;what reflections!&mdash;what recollections!&mdash;Oh,
      Leonora, look at the lights upon that mountain, and the deep shadows upon
      the lake below. Just such scenes have I admired, by such have I been
      entranced in Switzerland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonora put her arm within mine&mdash;she seemed to have no objection to
      my thoughts going back to Switzerland&mdash;I sighed&mdash;she pressed my
      hand affectionately&mdash;I wiped the starting tear from my eye. Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;
      looked at me with something like surprise whilst I repeated involuntarily,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;I mourn, but, ye woodlands, I mourn not for you,
  For morn is approaching your charms to restore,
  Perfumed with fresh fragrance, and glitt&rsquo;ring with dew.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I paused, recollecting myself, struck with <i>the ridicule</i> of
      repeating verses, and of indulging feelings in which no one perhaps
      sympathized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are beautiful lines,&rdquo; said Leonora: &ldquo;that poem has always been a
      favourite of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of mine, also,&rdquo; said Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer Beattie&rsquo;s Hermit to all other hermits,&rdquo; said Leonora.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not in a mood calmly to discuss with her a point of criticism&mdash;I
      walked on in reverie: but in this I was not allowed to indulge. Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;asked
      if I could not recollect some more of the Hermit&mdash;I pleaded the worst
      memory in the world&mdash;a memory that can never recollect any poem
      perfectly by rote, only the touches of genius or sensibility that strike
      me&mdash;and those are so few!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in this poem there are so many,&rdquo; said Leonora. I am sure she insisted
      only to please her husband, and pleaded against her real feelings,
      purposely to conceal them. He persisted in his request, with more warmth
      than usual. I was compelled to rouse myself from my reverie, and to call
      back my distant thoughts. I repeated all that I could recollect of the
      poem. Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; paid me a profusion of compliments upon the
      sweetness of my voice, and my taste in reciting. He was pleased to find
      that my manner and tones gave an Italian expression to English poetry,
      which to him was a peculiar charm. It reminded him of some Signora, whom
      he had known at Florence. This was the first time I had learned that he
      had been abroad. I was going to explore the foreign field of conversation
      which he thus opened; but just at that moment Leonora withdrew her arm
      from mine, and I fancied that she coloured. This might be only my fancy,
      or the natural effect of her stooping to gather a flower. We were now
      within sight of the castle. I pointed to one of the turrets over a Gothic
      window, upon which the gleams of the setting sun produced a picturesque
      effect; my glove happened to be off, and Leonora unluckily saw that her
      husband&rsquo;s eyes were fixed upon my arm, instead of the turret to which I
      was pointing. &lsquo;Twas a trifle which I never should have noticed, had she
      not forced it upon my attention. She actually turned pale. I had the
      presence of mind not to put on my glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must observe more accurately; I must decide whether this angelic Leonora
      is, or is not susceptible of the mortal passion ycleped jealousy. I
      confess my curiosity is awakened.

    <h3>
      LETTER XXII.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      OLIVIA TO MADAME DE P&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      When the passions are asleep we are apt to fancy they are dead. I verily
      thought that curiosity was dead within me, it had lain so long dormant,
      while stronger and tenderer sentiments waked in full activity; but now
      that absence and distance from their object lull them to temporary repose,
      the vulgar subordinate passions are roused, and take their turn to reign.
      My curiosity was so strongly excited upon the subject of Leonora&rsquo;s
      jealousy, that I could not rest, without attempting to obtain
      satisfaction. Blame me not, dearest Gabrielle, for in my situation you
      would inevitably have done the same, only that you would have done it with
      more address; with that peculiar, inimitable address, which I envy above
      all your accomplishments. But address is a delicate native of France, and
      though it may now and then exist as a stranger, I doubt whether it can
      ever be naturalized in our rude climate. All the attempts I have made are,
      however, encouraging enough&mdash;you shall judge. My object was, to
      ascertain the existence or non-existence of Leonora&rsquo;s jealousy. I set
      about it with a tolerably careless assurance, and followed up the hint
      which accident had thrown out for my ingenuity to work upon. You remember,
      or at least I remember, that Leonora withdrew her arm from mine, and
      stooped to gather a flower at the moment when her husband mentioned
      Florence, and the resemblance of my voice to that of some Italian charmer.
      The next day I happened to play some of my sweetest Italian airs, and to
      accompany them with my voice. The music-room opens into the great hall:
      Leonora and her husband were in the hall, talking to some visitors. The
      voices were soon hushed, as I expected, by the magic sounds, but, what I
      did not expect, Leonora was the first who led the way into the music-room.
      Was this affectation? These <i>simple</i> characters sometimes baffle all
      the art of the decipherer. I should have been clear that it was
      affectation, had Leonora been prodigal of compliments on my performance;
      but she seemed only to listen for her own pleasure, and left it to Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;
      to applaud. Whilst I was preparing to play over again the air which
      pleased him most, the two little nephews came running to beg Leonora would
      follow them to look at some trifle, some coloured shadow, upon the
      garden-wall, I think they said: she let them lead her off, leaving <i>us</i>
      together. This did not seem like jealousy. I was more at a loss than ever,
      and determined to make fresh and more decisive experiments. Curiosity, you
      know, is heightened by doubt. To cure myself of curiosity, it is necessary
      therefore to put my mind out of doubt. Admire the practical application of
      metaphysics! But metaphysics always make you yawn. Adieu for to-day.

    <p>
      Dear Margaret, an uncle of mine, who, ever since I can remember, seemed to
      me cut out for an old bachelor, writes me word that he is just going to be
      married, and that I must grace his nuptials. I cannot refuse, for he has
      always been very kind to me, and we have no right to cut people out for
      old bachelors. That I am sorry to leave Leonora, it is superfluous to tell
      you; but this is the melancholy part of the business, on which I make it a
      principle to dwell as little as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Olivia must be heartily glad that I am going, for I have been
      terribly troublesome to her by my gaiety and my <i>simplicity</i>. I shall
      lose all the pleasure I had promised myself in seeing the <i>dénouement</i>
      of the comedy of <i>The Sentimental Coquette</i>; or, <i>The Heroine
      unmasked</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made Leonora almost angry with me this morning, by a hint or two I gave
      upon this subject. She looked so very grave, that I was afraid of my own
      thoughts, and I dared not explain myself farther. Intimate as I am with
      her, there are points on which I am sure that she would never make me her
      confidante. I think that she has not been in her usual good spirits
      lately; and though she treats Olivia with uniform kindness, and betrays
      not, even to my watchful eyes, the slightest symptom of jealousy, yet I
      suspect that she sees what is going forward, and she suffers in secret.
      Now, if she would let me explain myself, I could set her heart at ease, by
      the assurance that Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; is only acting a part. If her
      affection for her husband did not almost blind her, she would have as much
      penetration as I have&mdash;which you will allow, my dear Margaret, is
      saying a great deal.

      LETTER XXIV.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      OLIVIA TO MADAME DE P&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      L&mdash;&mdash; Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Congratulate me, my charming Gabrielle, upon being delivered from the
      unfeeling gaiety of that friend of Leonora, that Helen of whom I formerly
      sent you a too flattering portrait. Her departure relieves me from many
      painful sensations. Dissonance to a musical ear is not more horrid, than
      want of harmony between characters, to the soul of sensibility. Between
      Helen and me there was a perpetual discord of ideas and sentiments, which
      fatigued me inexpressibly. Besides, I began to consider her as a spy upon
      my actions. But there, I believe, I did her injustice, for she was too
      much occupied with her own trifling thoughts to have any alarming powers
      of observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since her departure we have been very gay. Yesterday we had a large
      company at dinner; some of the neighbouring families, whom I expected to
      find mere country visitors, that were come a dozen miles to show their
      antediluvian finery, retire half an hour after dinner, spoil coffee with
      cream, say nothing, but at their appointed hours rise, ring for their
      superb carriages, and go home by moonlight. However, to my astonishment, I
      found myself in a society of well-bred, well-informed persons; the women
      ready to converse, and the men, even after dinner, not impatient to get
      rid of them. Two or three of the company had travelled, and I was glad to
      talk to them of Italy, Switzerland, and France. Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; I knew
      would join in this conversation. I discovered that he came to Florence
      just as I was leaving it. I was to have been at our ambassador&rsquo;s one
      evening when he was there; but a headache prevented me. These little
      coincidences, you know, my Gabrielle, draw people closer together. I
      remember to have heard of a Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; at Florence, who was a
      passionate admirer of our sex. He was then unmarried. I little thought
      that this was the same person. Beneath a cold exterior these Englishmen
      often conceal a wondrous quantity of enthusiasm&mdash;volcanoes under
      snow. Curiosity, dear indefatigable curiosity, supported me through the
      labour of clearing away the snow, and I came to indubitable traces of
      unextinguished and unextinguishable fire. The character of L&mdash;&mdash;
      is quite different from what I had imagined it to be. It is an <i>excellent
      study</i>. We had a long and interesting conversation upon national
      manners, especially upon those of the females of all nations. He concluded
      by quoting the words of your friend M. le Vicomte de Segur, &ldquo;If I were
      permitted to choose, I should prefer a French woman for my friend, an
      English woman for my wife, and a Polish lady for my mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From this, it seems, that I am mistaken about the Italian signora, or else
      Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; has an enlarged charity for the graces of all nations.&mdash;More
      subject for curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, before the company separated, we were standing on the
      steps of the great hall, looking at a fine effect of moonlight, and I
      pointed out the shadow of the arches of a bridge. From moonlight we went
      on to lamplight, and many pretty things were said about art and nature. A
      gentleman, who had just returned from Paris, talked of the reflection of
      the lamps in the Seine, which one sees in crossing the Pont-Royal, and
      which, as he said, appear like a colonnade of fire. As soon as he had
      finished <i>prosing</i> about his colonnade, I turned to Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;,
      and asked if he remembered the account which Coxe the traveller gives of
      the Polish princess Czartoryski&rsquo;s charming <i>fête champêtre</i> and the
      illuminated rustic bridge of one arch, the reflection of which in the
      water was so strong as to deceive the eye, and to give the whole the
      appearance of a brilliant circle suspended in the air. Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;
      seemed enchanted with my description, and eagerly said that he would some
      night have a bridge in his improvements, illuminated, that <i>we</i>
      (half-gallant Englishman!) might see the effect. I carelessly replied,
      that probably it would have a good effect: I would then have talked on
      other subjects to the lady next me: but an Englishman cannot suddenly
      change the course of his conversation. Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; still persisted
      in asking a variety of questions about this Polish fête. I excused myself;
      for if you satisfy curiosity you are no longer sublime; besides it is so
      pedantic to remember <i>accurately</i> any thing one meets with in books.
      I assured him that I had forgotten the particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      My countrymen are wondrous persevering, when once roused. This morning,
      when I came down to breakfast, I found Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; with a volume
      of Coxe&rsquo;s travels in his hand. He read aloud to Leonora the whole
      description of the illuminated gardens, and of a Turkish tent of curious
      workmanship, and of a pavilion, supported by pillars, ornamented with
      wreaths of flowers. Leonora&rsquo;s birthday is some time in the next month; and
      her husband, probably to prevent any disagreeable little feelings,
      proposed that the <i>fête champêtre</i>, he designed to give, should be on
      that day. She seemed rather to discourage the thing. Now to what should
      this indifference be attributed? To jealousy I should positively decide,
      but that two reasons oppose this idea, and keep me in doubt. She was not
      within hearing at the moonlight conference, and knew nothing of my having
      mentioned the Polish fête, or of her husband&rsquo;s having proposed to
      illuminate the bridge for me. Besides, I remember, the other day when she
      was reading the new French novel you sent me, she expressed great dislike
      to the sentimental fêtes, which the lover prepares for his mistress. I
      would give more than I dare tell you, my dear Gabrielle, to be able to
      decide whether she is jealous of me or not. But where was I? Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;,
      who had set his heart upon the <i>fête champêtre</i>, persisted, and
      combatted her antipathy by reason. Foolish man! he should have tried
      compliments, or caresses&mdash;if I had not been present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Leonora,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I think you carry your dislike to these
      things too far. They are more according to the French than to the English
      taste, I know; but we should not be influenced by national prejudice. I
      detest the ostentation and the affectation of sentiment as much as you
      can; but where the real feeling exists, every mode of showing kindness is
      agreeable. You must let us have this little fête on your birthday. Besides
      the pleasure it will give me, I really think it is useful to mix ideas of
      affection with amusement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled most graciously, and replied, that she would with pleasure
      accept of kindness in any form from him. In short, she was willing to have
      the fête, when it was clearly explained that she was to be the object of
      it. Is not this proof positive of jealousy? And yet my curiosity is not
      thoroughly satisfied. I must go on; for Leonora&rsquo;s sake I must go on. When
      I have been assured of the truth, I shall know how to conduct myself; and
      you, who know my heart, will do me the justice to believe, that when I am
      convinced of my friend&rsquo;s weakness, I shall spare it with the most delicate
      caution: but till I am convinced, I am in perpetual danger of blundering
      by my careless, inadvertent innocence. You smile, Gabrielle; dear
      malicious Gabrielle, even in your malice you are charming! Adieu! Pray for
      the speedy extinction of my curiosity.

      LETTER XXV.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      LEONORA TO HER MOTHER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      You say, my dearest mother, that of late, my letters have been more
      constrained and less cheerful than usual, and you conjure me not to
      conceal from you any thing which may concern my happiness. I have ever
      found you my best and most indulgent friend, and there is not a thought or
      feeling of my mind, however weak or foolish, that I desire to conceal from
      you. No one in this world is more&mdash;is so much interested in my
      happiness; and, in every doubtful situation, I have always been accustomed
      to apply to your unerring judgment for assistance. Your strength of mind,
      your enlightened affection, would support and direct me, would at once
      show me how I ought to act, and inspire me with courage and fortitude
      sufficient to be worthy of your esteem and of my own. At no period of my
      life, not even when my heart first felt the confused sensations of a
      passion that was new to it, did I ever want or wish for a friend so much
      as at this instant: and yet I hesitate whether I ought to ask even your
      advice, whether I ought to indulge myself in speaking of my feelings even
      to my mother. I refrained from giving the slightest intimation of them to
      my dear Helen, though she often led to this subject, and seemed vexed by
      my reserve. I thought it not right to accept of her sympathy. From her
      kindness I had every consolation to expect, but no assistance from her
      counsels, because she does not understand Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s character,
      and I could plainly perceive that she had an erroneous idea so fixed in
      her fancy, as to prevent her seeing things in their true light. I am
      afraid of imputing blame where I most wish to avoid it: I fear to excite
      unjust suspicions; I dread that if I say the whole, you will imagine that
      I mean much more than I say.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not been quite well lately, and my mind probably is more apt to be
      alarmed than it would be, if my health were stronger. All that I
      apprehend, may exist merely in my own distempered imagination. Do not then
      suppose others are to blame, when perhaps I only am in fault. I have for
      some time past been dissatisfied with myself, and have had reason to be
      so: I do not say this from any false humility; I despise that affectation;
      but I say it with a sincere desire that you may assist me to cure myself
      of a weakness, which, if it were to grow upon my mind, must render me
      miserable, and might destroy the happiness of the person I love best upon
      earth. You know that I am not naturally or habitually of a suspicious
      temper, but I am conscious of having lately felt a disposition to
      jealousy. I have been spoiled by the excessive attention, which my husband
      paid to me in the first year of our marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      You warned me not to fancy that he could continue always a lover. I did
      not, at least I tried not to expect such an impossibility. I was prepared
      for the change, at least I thought I was: yet now the time, the inevitable
      time is come, and I have not the fortitude to bear it as I ought. If I had
      never known what it was to possess his love, I might perhaps be content
      with his friendship. If I could feel only friendship for him, I should
      now, possibly, be happy. I know that I have the first place in his esteem:
      I do believe&mdash;I should be miserable indeed if I did not believe&mdash;that
      I have the first place in his affection. But this affection is certainly
      different from what it once was. I wish I could forget the difference. No:
      I retract that wish; however painful the comparison, the recollection of
      times that are past is delightful to my heart. Yet, my dear mother, if
      such times are never to return, it would be better for me to forget that
      they have ever been. It would be wiser not to let my imagination recur to
      the past, which could then tend only to render me discontented with the
      present and with the future. The FUTURE! how melancholy that word sounds
      to me! What a dreary length of prospect it brings to my view! How young I
      am, how many years may I have to live, and how little motive have I left
      in life! Those which used to act most forcibly upon me, have now scarcely
      power to move my mind. The sense of duty, it is true, raises me to some
      degree of exertion; I hope that I do not neglect the education of the two
      children whom my poor sister bequeathed to my care. When my mind was at
      ease they were my delight; but now I feel that I am rather interrupted
      than interested by their childish gaiety and amusements.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am afraid that I am growing selfish, and I am sure that I have become
      shamefully indolent. I go on with certain occupations every day from
      habit, not from choice; my mind is not in them. I used to flatter myself
      that I did many things, from a sense of duty and of general benevolence,
      which I am convinced were done merely from a particular wish to please,
      and to make myself more and more beloved by the object of my fondest
      affection. Disappointed in this hope, I sink into indolence, from which
      the desire to entertain my friends is not sufficient to rouse me. Helen
      has been summoned away; but I believe I told you that Mr. and Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash;,
      whose company is peculiarly agreeable to my taste, and Lady M&mdash;&mdash;
      and her amiable daughters, and your witty friend &mdash;&mdash;, are with
      us. In such society I am ashamed of being stupid; yet I cannot contribute
      to the amusement of the company, and I feel surprised at their animation
      and sprightliness. It seems as if I was looking on at dances, without
      hearing any music. Sometimes I fear that my silence should be observed,
      and then I begin to talk, without well knowing what I am saying. I confine
      myself to the most common-place subjects, and hesitate, from the dread of
      saying something quite foreign to the purpose. What must Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;
      think of my stupidity? But he does not, I believe, perceive it: he is so
      much occupied with&mdash;with other objects. I am glad that he does not
      see all that passes in my mind, for he might despise me if he knew that I
      am so miserable. I did not mean to use so strong an expression; but now it
      is written, I will not blot it out, lest you should fancy something worse
      than the reality. I am not, however, yet so weak as to be seriously <i>miserable</i>
      when I have no real cause to be so. The truth is &mdash;&mdash;. Now you
      know this phrase is a tacit confession that all that has been said before
      is false. The real truth is &mdash;&mdash;. By my prefacing so long you
      may be sure that I have reason to be ashamed of this real truth&rsquo;s coming
      out. The real truth is, that I have been so long accustomed to be the
      first and <i>only</i> object of Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s thoughts, that I
      cannot bear to see him think of any thing else. Yes, <i>things</i> I can
      bear; but not <i>persons</i>&mdash;female persons; and there is one person
      here, who is so much more agreeable and entertaining than I am, that she
      engrosses very naturally almost all his attention. I am not <i>envious</i>,
      I am sure; for I could once admire all Lady Olivia&rsquo;s talents and
      accomplishments, and no one could be more charmed than I was, with her
      fascinating manners and irresistible powers of pleasing; but when those
      irresistible powers may rob me of the heart of my beloved husband&mdash;of
      the whole happiness of my life&mdash;how can I admire them? All I can
      promise is to preserve my mind from the meanness of suspicion. I can do my
      rival justice. I can believe, and entreat you to believe, that she does
      not wish to be my rival: that she is perfectly innocent of all design to
      injure me, and that she is not aware of the impression she has made. I,
      who know every change of Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s countenance, every
      inflexion of his voice, every turn of his mind, can see too plainly what
      she cannot discern. I should indeed have thought, that no woman, whom he
      distinguished or preferred in any degree, could avoid perceiving it, his
      manner is so expressive, so flattering; but perhaps this appears so only
      to me&mdash;a woman, who does not love him, may see things very
      differently. Lady Olivia can be in no danger, because her heart,
      fortunately for me, is prepossessed in favour of another; and a woman
      whose heart is occupied by one object is absolutely blind, as I well know,
      to all others. With this security I ought to be satisfied; for I believe
      no one inspires a lasting passion, without sharing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am summoned to give my opinion about certain illuminations and
      decorations for a <i>fête champêtre</i> which Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; is so
      kind as to give in honour of my birthday&mdash;just at the time I am
      complaining of his neglect!&mdash;No, dear mother, I hope I have not
      complained of <i>him</i>, but of <i>myself</i>:&mdash;and it is your
      business to teach your daughter to be more reasonable. Write soon and

      LETTER XXVI.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      OLIVIA TO MADAME DE P&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      This fine <i>fête champêtre</i> is over.&mdash;Expect no description of it
      from me, Gabrielle, for I am horribly out of humour. The whole pleasure of
      the evening was destroyed by the most foolish circumstance imaginable.
      Leonora&rsquo;s jealousy is now evident to more eyes than mine. No farther doubt
      upon the subject can remain. My curiosity is satisfied; but I am now left
      to reproach myself, for having gone so far to ascertain what I ought to
      have taken for granted. All these good English wives are jealous; so
      jealous, that no one, who has any pretensions to beauty, wit, or <i>amiability</i>,
      can live with them. They can have no <i>society</i> in our sense of the
      word; of course they must live shut up in their own dismal houses, with
      their own stupid families, the faithful husband and wife sitting opposite
      to each other in their own chimney corners, yawning models of constancy.
      And this they call virtue! How the meanest vices usurp the name of virtue!
      Leonora&rsquo;s is a jealousy of the most illiberal and degrading species; a
      jealousy of the temper, not of the heart. She is too cold to feel the
      passion of love.&mdash;She never could be in love; of that I am certain.
      She is too reasonable, too prudish. Besides, to imagine that she could be
      in love with her own husband, and after eighteen months&rsquo; marriage&mdash;the
      thing is absurd! the thing is impossible! No, she deceives herself or him,
      or both, if she pretends that her jealousy arises from love, from what you
      and I, Gabrielle, understand by the word. Passion, and passion only, can
      plead a just excuse of its own excesses. Were Leonora in love, I could
      pardon her jealousy. But now I despise it. Yes, with all her high
      reputation, and <i>imposing</i> qualities, I must think of her with
      contempt. And now that I have given vent to my feelings, with that freedom
      in which I ever indulge myself in writing to you, my amiable Gabrielle,
      chosen friend of my heart, I will compose myself, and give you a rational
      account of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know that I am said to have some taste. Leonora makes no pretensions
      to any. Wishing, I suppose, that her fête should be as elegant as
      possible, she consulted me about all the arrangements and decorations. It
      was I that did every thing. My skill and taste were admired by the whole
      company, and especially by Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;. He was in remarkably good
      spirits at the commencement of the evening; quite gay and gallant: he
      certainly paid me a great deal of attention, and it was natural he should;
      for besides being his guest, I was undoubtedly the most elegant woman
      present. My fame had gone abroad; I found that I was the object of general
      attention. To this I have been tolerably well accustomed all my life;
      enough at least to prevent me from giving any visible sign of being moved
      by admiration in whatever form it comes; whether in the polite foreign
      glance, or the broad English stare. The starers enjoyed their pleasure,
      and I mine: I moved and talked, I smiled or was pensive, as though I saw
      them not; nevertheless the homage of their gaze was not lost upon me. You
      know, my charming Gabrielle, one likes to observe the <i>sensation</i> one
      produces amongst new people. The incense that I perceived in the
      surrounding atmosphere was just powerful enough to affect my nerves
      agreeably: that languor which you have so often reproached me for
      indulging in the company of what we call <i>indifferents</i> gradually
      dissipated; and, as poor R&mdash;&mdash; used to say of me, I came from
      behind my cloud like the sun in all its glory. I was such as you have seen
      me, Gabrielle, in my best days, in my best moments, in my very best style.
      I wonder what would excite me to such a waste of powers. L&mdash;&mdash;
      seemed inspired too: he really was quite agreeable, and showed me off
      almost as well as R&mdash;&mdash; himself could have done. I had no idea
      that he had this species of talent. You will never know of what my
      countrymen are capable, for you are out of patience with the statues the
      first half hour: now it takes an amazing time to animate them; but they
      can be waked into life, and I have a pride in conquering difficulties.&mdash;There
      were more men this night, in proportion to the women, than one usually
      sees in English company, consequently it was more agreeable. I was
      surrounded by an admiring audience, and my conversation of course was
      sufficiently general to please all, and sufficiently particular to
      distinguish the man whom I wished to animate. In all this you will say
      there was nothing to put one out of humour, nothing very mortifying:&mdash;but
      stay, my fair philosopher, do not judge of the day till you see its end.&mdash;Leonora
      was so hid from my view by the crowd of adorers, that I really did not
      discern her, or suspect her jealousy. I was quite natural; I thought only
      of myself; I declined all invitations to dance, declaring that it was so
      long since I had tried an English country dance, that I dared not expose
      my awkwardness. French country dances were mentioned, but I preferred
      conversation. At last L&mdash;&mdash; persecuted me to try a Polish dance
      with him&mdash;a multitude of voices overpowered me. I have not the talent
      which some of my countrywomen possess in such perfection, of being
      obstinate about trifles. When I can refuse with grace, &lsquo;tis well; but when
      that is no longer possible, it is my principle, or my weakness, to yield.
      I was surprised to find that L&mdash;&mdash;danced admirably. I became
      animated. You know how dancing animates me, when I have a partner who <i>can</i>
      dance&mdash;a thing not very common in this country. We ended by <i>waltzing</i>,
      first in the Polish, and afterwards in the Parisian manner. I certainly
      surpassed myself&mdash;I flew, I was borne upon the wings of the wind, I
      floated on the notes of the music. Animated or languid in every gradation
      of grace and sentiment, I abandoned myself to the inspiration of the
      moment; I was all soul, and the spectators were all admiration. To you, my
      Gabrielle, I may speak thus of myself without vanity: you know the
      sensation I was accustomed to produce at Paris; you may guess then what
      the effect must be here, where such a style of dancing has all the
      captivation of novelty. Had I doubted that my <i>success</i> was complete,
      I should have been assured of it by the faces of some prudes amongst the
      matrons, who affected to think that the waltz was <i>too much</i>. As L&mdash;&mdash;
      was leading, or rather supporting me to my seat, for I was quite
      exhausted, I overheard a gentleman, who was at no great distance from the
      place where Leonora was standing, whisper to his neighbour, &ldquo;Le Valse
      extrême est la volupté permise.&rdquo; I fancy Leonora overheard these words, as
      well as myself, for my eyes met hers at this instant, and she coloured,
      and directly looked another way. L&mdash;&mdash; neither heard nor saw any
      thing of all this: he was intent upon procuring me a seat; and an
      Englishman can never see or think of two things at a time. A few minutes
      afterwards, whilst he was fanning me, a young awkward peasant girl, quite
      a stranger in this country, came up to me, and dropping her novice curtsy,
      said, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a ring, my lady, I found on the grass; they tell me it is
      yours, my lady!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my good girl, it is not mine,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Lady Leonora&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of her name Leonora came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked alternately at us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you doubt,&rdquo; cried Colonel A&mdash;&mdash;, &ldquo;which of these ladies is
      Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, sir; this is she, <i>to be sure</i>,&rdquo; said the girl, pointing to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      What there was in the girl&rsquo;s accent, or in L&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s look, when
      she pronounced the words, or in mine, or in all three together, I cannot
      exactly describe; but Leonora felt it. She turned as pale as death. I
      looked as unconscious as I could. L&mdash;&mdash; went on fanning me,
      without seeing his wife&rsquo;s change of countenance. Leonora&mdash;would you
      believe it?&mdash;sank upon a bench behind us, and fainted. How her
      husband started, when he felt her catch by his arm as she fell! He threw
      down the fan, left me, ran for water&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, Lady Leonora! Lady Leonora
      is ill!&rdquo; exclaimed every voice. The consternation was wonderful. They
      carried her ladyship to a spot where she could have free air. I was
      absolutely in an instant left alone, and seemingly as much forgotten as if
      I had never existed! I was indeed so much astonished, that I could not
      stir from the place where I stood; till, recollecting myself, I pushed my
      way through the crowd, and came in view of Leonora just as she opened her
      eyes. As soon as she came to herself, she made an effort to stand, saying
      that she was quite well again, but that she would go into the house and
      repose herself for a few minutes. As she rose, a hundred arms were offered
      at once to her assistance. She stepped forward; and, to my surprise, and I
      believe to the surprise of every body else, took mine, made a sign to her
      husband not to follow us, and walked quickly towards the house. Her woman,
      with a face of terror, met us, as we were going into Lady Leonora&rsquo;s
      apartment, with salts and hartshorn, and I know not what in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite well, quite well again; I do not want any thing; I do not want
      any thing. I do not want you, Mason,&rdquo; said Leonora. &ldquo;Lady Olivia is so
      good as to assist me. I am come in only to rest for a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman gave me an evil look, and left the room. Never did I wish any
      thing more than that she should have stayed. I was absolutely so
      embarrassed, so distressed, when I found myself alone with Leonora, that I
      knew not what to say. I believe I began with a sentence about the night
      air, that was very little to the purpose. The sight of some baby-linen
      which the maid had been making suggested to me something which I thought
      more appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear creature!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;why will you fatigue yourself. so terribly,
      and stand so much and so long in your situation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonora neither accepted nor rejected my interpretation of what had
      passed. She made no reply; but fixed her eyes upon me as if she would have
      read my very soul. Never did I see or feel eyes so expressive or so
      powerful as hers were at this, moment. Mine absolutely fell beneath them.
      What deprived me of presence of mind I know not; but I was utterly without
      common sense. I am sure I changed colour, and Leonora must have seen it
      through my rouge, for I had only the slightest tinge upon my cheeks. The
      consciousness that she saw me blush disconcerted me beyond recovery; it is
      really quite unaccountable: I trembled all over as I stood before her; I
      was forced to have recourse to the hartshorn and water, which stood upon
      the table. Leonora rose, and threw open the window to give me fresh air.
      She pressed my hand, but rather with an air of forgiveness than of
      affection; I was mortified and vexed; but my pride revived me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had better return to the company as soon as possible, I believe,&rdquo; said
      she, looking down at the moving crowd below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready to attend you, my dear,&rdquo; said I, coldly, &ldquo;whenever you feel
      yourself sufficiently rested and composed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left the room, and I followed. You have no idea of the solicitude with
      which the people hoped she was <i>better</i>&mdash;and <i>well</i>&mdash;and
      <i>quite well</i>, &amp;c. What amazing importance a fainting fit can
      sometimes bestow! Her husband seemed no longer to have any eyes or soul
      but for her. At supper, and during the rest of the night, she occupied the
      whole attention of every body present. Can you conceive any thing so
      provoking? But L&mdash;&mdash; must be an absolute fool!&mdash;Did he
      never see a woman faint before?&mdash;He cannot pretend to be in love with
      his wife&mdash;I do not understand it.&mdash;But this I know, that he has
      been totally different in his manner towards me these three days past.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now that my curiosity is satisfied about Leonora&rsquo;s jealousy, I shall
      absolutely perish with ennui in this stupid place. Adieu, dearest
      Gabrielle! How I envy you! The void of my heart is insupportable. I must
      have some passion to keep me alive. Forward any letters from poor R&mdash;&mdash;,
      if he has written under cover to you.

      LETTER XXVII.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      THE DUCHESS OF &mdash;&mdash; TO HER DAUGHTER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Take courage, my beloved daughter; take courage. Have a just confidence in
      yourself and in your husband. For a moment he may be fascinated by the
      arts of an unprincipled woman; for a moment she may triumph over his
      senses, and his imagination; but of his esteem, his affection, his heart,
      she cannot rob you. These have been, ought to be, will be yours. Trust to
      your mother&rsquo;s prophecy, my child. You may trust to it securely: for, well
      as she loves you&mdash;and no mother ever loved a daughter better&mdash;she
      does not soothe you with mere words of doting fondness; she speaks to you
      the language of reason and of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know what such a man as Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; must esteem and love; I know
      of what such a woman as my daughter is capable, when her whole happiness,
      and the happiness of all that is dear to her, are at stake. The loss of
      temporary admiration and power, the transient preference shown to a
      despicable rival, will not provoke you to imprudent reproach, nor sink you
      to helpless despair. The arts of an Olivia might continue to deceive your
      husband, if he were a fool; or to please him, if he were a libertine: but
      he has a heart formed for love, he cannot therefore be a libertine: he is
      a man of superior abilities, and knows women too well to be a dupe. With a
      penetrating and discriminative judgment of character, he is a nice
      observer of female manners; his taste is delicate even to excess; under a
      cold exterior he has a vivid imagination and strong sensibility; he has
      little vanity, but a superabundance of pride; he wishes to be ardently
      loved, but this he conceals; it is difficult to convince him that he is
      beloved, and scarcely possible to satisfy him by any common proofs of
      attachment. A coquette will never attach Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;. The
      admiration which others might express for her charms and accomplishments,
      would never pique him to competition: far from seeking &ldquo;to win her praise
      whom all admire,&rdquo; he would disdain to enter the lists with the vulgar
      multitude: a heart, in which he had a probability of holding only divided
      empire, would not appear to him worth the winning. As a coquette, whatever
      may be her talents, graces, accomplishments, and address, you have nothing
      seriously to fear from Lady Olivia.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, my dear, Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s mind may be in a situation to require
      amusement. That species of apathy which succeeds to passion is not, as the
      inexperienced imagine, the death of love, but the necessary and salutary
      repose from which it awakens refreshed and revived. Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s
      passion for you has been not only tender, but violent, and the calm, which
      inevitably succeeds, should not alarm you.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a man feels that his fondness for a wife is suspended, he is uneasy
      in her company, not only from the sense of decreased pleasure, but from
      the fear of her observation and detection. If she reproach him, affairs
      become worse; he blames himself, he fears to give pain whenever he is in
      her presence: if he attempt to conceal his feelings, and to appear what he
      is no longer, a lover, his attempts are awkward; he becomes more and more
      dissatisfied with himself; and the person who compels him to this
      hypocrisy, who thus degrades him in his own eyes, must certainly be in
      danger of becoming an object of aversion. A wife, who has sense enough to
      abstain from all reproaches, direct or indirect, by word or look, may
      reclaim her husband&rsquo;s affections: the bird escapes from his cage, but
      returns to his nest. I am glad that you have agreeable company at your
      house; they will amuse Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, and relieve you from the
      necessity of taking a share in any conversation that you dislike. Our
      witty friend &mdash;&mdash;will supply your share of conversation; and as
      to your silence, remember that witty people are always content with those
      who <i>act audience</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rejoice that you persist in your daily occupations. To a mind like
      yours, the sense of performing your duty will, next to religion, be the
      firmest support upon which you can rely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, my dear, even when you read this, you will still be inclined to
      justify Lady Olivia, and to conceal from your heart the suspicions which
      her conduct excites. I am not surprised, that you should find it difficult
      to believe, that one to whom you have behaved so generously, should treat
      you with treachery, and ingratitude. I am not surprised, that you who feel
      what it is to love, should think, that a woman whose heart is occupied by
      attachment to one object, must be incapable of thinking of any other. But
      love in such a heart as yours is totally different from what it is in the
      fancy of these heroines. In their imagination, the objects are as fleeting
      as the pictures in the clouds chased by the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Lady Olivia expect nothing: depend only on yourself. When you become,
      as you soon must, completely convinced that the woman, in whom your
      unsuspecting soul confided, is utterly unworthy of your esteem, refrain
      from all imprudent expressions of indignation. I despise&mdash;you will
      soon hate&mdash;your rival; but in the moment of detection think of what
      is due to yourself, and act as calmly as if you had never loved her. She
      will suffer no pain from the loss of your friendship: she has not a heart
      that can value it. Probably she is envious of you. All these women desire
      to mortify those whom they cannot degrade to their own level: and I am
      inclined to suspect that this malevolent feeling, joined to the want of
      occupation, may be the cause of her present conduct. Her manoeuvres will
      not ultimately succeed. She will be deserted by Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;,
      disappointed and disgraced, and your husband will be more yours than ever.
      When this happy moment comes, my Leonora; when your husband returns,
      preferring yours to all other society, then will be the time to exert all
      your talents, all your charms, to prove your superiority in every thing,
      but most in love. The soothings of female tenderness, in certain
      situations, have power not only to calm the feelings of self-reproach, but
      to diffuse delight over the soul of man. The oil, which the skilful
      mariner throws upon the sea, not only smooths the waves in the storm, but
      when the sun shines, spreads the most beautiful colours over the surface
      of the waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear daughter, though your mother writes seemingly at her ease, you
      must not fancy that she does not feel for you. Do not imagine, that in the
      coldness of extinguished passions, and in the pride of counselling age,
      your mother expects to charm agony with words. No, my child, I am not so
      absurd, so cruel. Your letter forced tears from eyes, which are not used
      like sentimental eyes to weep upon every trifling occasion. My first wish
      was to set out immediately to see you; but whatever consolation or
      pleasure my company might afford, I believe it might be disadvantageous to
      you in your present circumstances. I could not be an hour in the room with
      this Lady Olivia, without showing some portion of the indignation and
      contempt that I feel for her conduct. This warmth of mine might injure you
      in your husband&rsquo;s opinion. Though you would have too strong a sense of
      propriety, and too much dignity of mind, to make complaints of your
      husband to me, or to any one living; yet it might be supposed that your
      mother was your confidante in secret, and your partisan in public: this
      might destroy your domestic happiness. No husband can or ought to endure
      the idea of his wife&rsquo;s caballing against him. I admire and shall respect
      your dignified silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now fare you well, my dearest child. May God bless you! If a mother&rsquo;s
      prayers could avail, you would be the happiest of human beings. I do,
      without partiality, believe you to be one of the best and most amiable of
      women. &mdash;&mdash;

    <h3>
      LETTER XXVIII.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      LEONORA TO HER MOTHER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Had your letter, my dearest mother, reached me a few hours sooner, I
      should not have exposed myself as I have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday, at our <i>fête champêtre</i>, you would have been ashamed of
      me. I am ashamed of myself. I did the very reverse of what I ought, of
      what I would have done, if I had been fortified by your counsel. Instead
      of being calm and dignified, I was agitated beyond all power of control. I
      lost all presence of mind, all common sense, all recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know your contempt for swooning heroines. What will you say, when you
      hear that your daughter fainted&mdash;fainted in public? I believe,
      however, that, as soon as I recovered, I had sufficient command over
      myself to prevent the accident from being attributed to the real cause,
      and I hope that the very moment I came to my recollection, my manner
      towards Lady Olivia was such as to preclude all possibility of her being
      blamed or even suspected. From living much abroad, she has acquired a
      certain freedom of manner, and latitude of thinking, which expose her to
      suspicion; but of all serious intention to injure me, or to pass the
      bounds of propriety, I totally acquit her. She is not to blame for the
      admiration she excites, nor is she to be the sufferer for my weakness of
      mind or of health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great and unreasonable folly I am sure I showed&mdash;but I shall do so no
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The particular circumstances I need not explain: you may be assured, that
      wherever I think it right to be silent, nothing shall tempt me to speak:
      but I understood, by the conclusion of your letter, that you expect me to
      preserve an absolute silence upon this subject in future: this I will not
      promise. I cannot conceive that I, who do not mean to injure any human
      being, ought, because I am unhappy, and when I am most in want of a
      friend, to be precluded from the indulgence of speaking of what is nearest
      my heart to that dear, safe, most enlightened, and honourable of friends,
      who has loved, guided, instructed, and encouraged me in every thing that
      is right from my infancy. Why should I be refused all claim to sympathy?
      why must my thoughts and feelings be shut up in my own breast? and why
      must I be a solitary being, proscribed from commerce with my own family,
      with my beloved mother, to whom I have been accustomed to tell every
      feeling and idea as they arose? No; to all that is honourable I will
      strictly conform; but, by the superstition of prudence, I do not hold
      myself bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be kinder than my husband&rsquo;s conduct to me the evening after
      I was taken ill. He left home early this morning; he is gone to meet his
      friend, General B&mdash;&mdash;, who has just returned from abroad. I hope
      that Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; will be absent only a few days; for it would be
      fatal to my happiness if he should find amusement at a distance from home.
      His home, at all events, shall never be made a cage to him; when he
      returns, I will exert myself to the utmost to make it agreeable. This I
      hope can be done without obtruding my company upon him, or putting myself
      in competition with any person. I could wish that some fortunate accident
      might induce Lady Olivia to leave us before Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s return.
      Had I the same high opinion of her generosity that I once formed, had I
      the same perfect confidence in her integrity and in her friendship for me,
      I would go this moment and tell her all that passes in my heart: no
      humiliation of my vanity would cost me any thing if it could serve the
      interests of my love; no mean pride could stand in my mind against the
      force of affection. But there is a species of pride which I cannot, will
      not renounce&mdash;believing, as I do, that it is the companion, the
      friend, the support of virtue. This pride, I trust, will never desert me:
      it has grown with my growth; it was implanted in my character by the
      education which my dear mother gave me; and now, even by her, it cannot be
      eradicated. Surely I have misunderstood one passage in your letter: you
      cannot advise your daughter to restrain just indignation against vice from
      any motive of policy or personal interest. You say to me, &ldquo;In the moment
      of detection think of what is due to yourself, and act as calmly as if you
      had never loved her.&rdquo; If I <i>could</i>, I would not do this. Contempt
      shown by virtue is the just punishment of vice, a punishment which no
      selfish consideration should mitigate. If I were convinced that Lady
      Olivia were guilty, would you have me behave to her as if I believed her
      to be innocent? My countenance, my voice, my principles, would revolt from
      such mean and pernicious hypocrisy, degrading to the individual, and
      destructive to society.
    </p>
    <p>
      May I never more see the smile of love on the lips of my husband, nor its
      expression in his eyes, if I do so degrade myself in my own opinion and in
      his! Yes, in his; for would not he, would not any man of sense or
      delicacy, recur to that idea so common with his sex, and so just, that if
      a woman will sacrifice her sense of honour to her passions in one
      instance, she may in another? Would he not argue, &ldquo;If she will do this for
      me because she is in love with me, why not for a new favourite, if time or
      accident should make me less an object of passion?&rdquo; No; I may lose his
      love&mdash;this would be my misfortune: but to forfeit his esteem would be
      my fault; and, under the remorse which I should then have to endure, I am
      persuaded that no power of art or nature could sustain my existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for myself. As to the general good of society, that, I confess, is
      not at this moment the uppermost consideration in my mind; but I will add
      a few words on that subject, lest you should imagine me to be hurried away
      by my own feelings. Public justice and reason are, I think, on my side.
      What would become of the good order of society or the decency of families,
      if every politic wife were to receive or invite, or permit her husband&rsquo;s
      mistress to reside in her house? What would become of conjugal virtue in
      either sex, if the wife were in this manner not only to connive at the
      infidelity of her husband, but to encourage and provide for his
      inconsistency? If she enters into bonds of amity and articles of
      partnership with her rival, with that person by whom she has been most
      injured, instead of being the dignified sufferer, she becomes an object of
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dearest mother, my most respected friend, my sentiments on this subject
      cannot essentially differ from yours. I must have mistaken your meaning.
      Pray write quickly, and tell me so; and forgive, if you cannot approve of,
      the warmth with which I have spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am your truly affectionate
    </p>
    <p>
      And grateful daughter,

      LETTER XXIX.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      OLIVIA TO MADAME P&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      My amiable Gabrielle, I must be faithful to my promise of writing to you
      every week, though this place affords nothing new either in events or
      sentiment. Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s absence made this castle insupportably
      dull. A few days ago he returned home, and met me with an easy kind of
      indifference, provoking enough to a woman who has been accustomed to
      excite some sensation. However, I was rejoiced at this upon Leonora&rsquo;s
      account. She was evidently delighted, and her spirits and affections
      seemed to overflow involuntarily upon all around her; even to me her
      manner became quite frank and cordial, almost caressing. She is really
      handsome when she is animated, and her conversation this evening quite
      surprised me. I saw something of that playfulness, those light touches,
      that versatility of expression, those words that mean more than meet the
      ear; every thing, in short, that could charm in the most polished foreign
      society. Leonora seemed to be inspired with all the art of conversation,
      by the simple instinct of affection. What astonished me most was the grace
      with which she introduced some profound philosophical remarks. &ldquo;Such
      pearls,&rdquo; said Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, &ldquo;come from the deep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With all these talents, what might not Leonora be in proper hands! But now
      she is nothing except to her husband, and a few intimate friends. However,
      this is not my affair. Let me go on to what concerns myself. You may
      believe, my dear Gabrielle, that I piqued myself upon showing at least as
      much easy indifference as was shown to me: freedom encourages freedom. As
      there was no danger of my being too amiable, I did not think myself bound
      in honour or sentiment to keep myself in the shade; but I could not be as
      brilliant as you have seen me at your <i>soirées</i>: the magic circle of
      adorers, the inspiring power of numbers, the éclat of public <i>representation</i>,
      were wanting. I retired to my own apartment at night, quite out of humour
      with myself; and Josephine, as she undressed me, put me still further out
      of patience, by an ill-timed history of a dispute she has had with
      Leonora&rsquo;s Swiss servant. The Swiss and Josephine, it seems, came to high
      words in defence of their mistresses&rsquo; charms. Josephine provoked the Swiss
      by saying, that his lady might possibly be handsome if she were dressed in
      the French taste; <i>mais qu&rsquo;elle étoit bien Angloise</i>, and would be
      quite another thing if she had been at Paris. The Swiss retorted by
      observing, that Josephine&rsquo;s lady had indeed learnt in perfection at Paris
      <i>the art of making herself up</i>, which was quite necessary to a beauty
      <i>un peu passée</i>. The words were not more agreeable to me than they
      had been to Josephine. I wonder at her assurance in repeating them&mdash;&ldquo;Un
      peu passée!&rdquo; Many a woman in England, ten, fifteen years older than I am,
      has inspired a violent passion; and it has been observed, that power is
      retained by these mature charmers, longer than conquest can be preserved
      by inexperienced beauties. There are women who have learnt to combine, for
      their own advantage, and for that of their captives, all the pleasure and
      <i>conveniences</i> of society, all that a thorough knowledge of the world
      can give&mdash;women who have a sufficient attention to appearances,
      joined to a real contempt of all prejudices, especially that of constancy&mdash;women
      who possess that knowledge of the human heart, which well compensates
      transient bloom; who add the expression of sentiment to beautiful
      features, and who employ
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Gay smiles to comfort, April showers to move,
  And all the nature, all the art of Love.&rdquo;
 &mdash;&ldquo;Un peu passée!&rdquo; The Swiss is impertinent, and knows nothing of
the matter. His master knows but little more. He would, however, know
infinitely more if I could take the trouble to instruct him; to which
I am almost tempted for want of something better to do. Adieu, my
Gabrielle. R&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s silence is perfectly incomprehensible.

    <h3>
      OLIVIA TO MADAME DE P&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      So, my amiable Gabrielle, you are really interested in my letters, <i>though
      written during my English exile</i>, and you are curious to know whether
      any of my <i>potent spells</i> can wake into life this man of marble. I
      candidly confess you would inspire me with an ambition to raise my poor
      countrymen in your opinion, if I were not restrained by the sacred
      sentiment of friendship, which forbids me to rival Leonora <i>even</i> in
      a husband&rsquo;s opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Josephine, who feels herself a party concerned ever since her
      battle with the Swiss, has piqued herself upon dressing me with exquisite
      taste. I am every day <i>mise à ravir</i>!&mdash;and with such perfection
      of art, that no art appears&mdash;all is negligent simplicity. I let
      Josephine please herself; for you know I am not bound to be frightful,
      because I have a friend whose husband may chance to turn his eye upon my
      figure, when he is tired of admiring hers. I rallied L&mdash;&mdash; the
      other day upon his having no eyes or ears but for his wife. Be assured I
      did it in such a manner that he could not be angry. Then I went on to a
      comparison between the <i>facility</i> of French and English society. He
      admitted that there was some truth and more wit in my observations. I was
      satisfied. With these reasonable men, the grand point for a woman is to
      amuse them&mdash;they can have logic from their own sex. But, my
      Gabrielle, I am summoned to the <i>salon</i>, and must finish my letter
      another day.

    <p>
      Heaven! can it be a fortnight since I wrote a line to my Gabrielle!&mdash;Where
      was I?&mdash;&ldquo;With these reasonable men the grand point for a woman is to
      amuse them.&rdquo; True&mdash;most true! L&mdash;&mdash;, believing himself only
      amused with my lively nonsense, indulged himself with it continually. I
      was to believe only what he believed. Presently he could not do without my
      conversation for more than two hours together. What was I to do, my
      Gabrielle? I walked out to avoid him. He found me in the woods&mdash;rallied
      me on my taste for solitude, and quoted Voltaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      This led to a metaphysical conversation, half playful, half serious:&mdash;the
      distinction which a man sometimes makes to his conscience between thinking
      a woman entertaining, and feeling her interesting, vanishes more easily,
      and more rapidly, than he is aware of&mdash;at least in certain
      situations. This was not an observation I could make to my companion in
      the woods, and he certainly did not make it for himself. It would have
      been vanity in me to have broken off our conversation, lest he should fall
      in love with me&mdash;it would have been blindness not to have seen that
      he was in some danger. I thought of Leonora&mdash;and sighed&mdash;and did
      all that was in my power to put him upon his guard. By way of
      preservative, I frankly made him a confession of my attachment to R&mdash;&mdash;.
      This I imagined would put things upon a right footing for ever; but, on
      the contrary, by convincing him of my innocence, and of my having no
      designs on his heart, this candour has, I fear, endangered him still more;
      yet I know not what to think&mdash;his manner is so variable towards me&mdash;I
      must be convinced of what his sentiments are, before I can decide what my
      conduct ought to be. Adieu, my amiable Gabrielle; I wait for something
      decisive with an inexpressible degree of anxiety&mdash;I will not now call
      it curiosity.&mdash;Apropos, does R&mdash;&mdash; wish that I should
      forget that he exists? What is this business that detains him? But why do
      I condescend to inquire?

    </p>
    <p>
      Advise me, dearest Gabrielle; I am in a delicate situation; and on your
      judgment and purity of heart I have the most perfect reliance. Know, then,
      that I begin to believe that Leonora&rsquo;s jealousy was not so absolutely
      absurd as I at first supposed. She understood her husband better than I
      did. I begin to fear that I have made a serious impression whilst I meant
      only to amuse myself. Heaven is my witness, I simply intended to satisfy
      my curiosity, and that once gratified, it was my determination to respect
      the weakness I discovered. To love Leonora, as once I imagined I could, is
      out of my power; but to disturb her peace, to destroy her happiness, to
      make use of the confidence she has reposed in me, the kindness she has
      shown by making me an inmate of her house&mdash;my soul shudders at these
      ideas. No&mdash;if her husband really loves me I will fly. Leonora shall
      see that Olivia is incapable of treachery&mdash;that Olivia has a soul
      generous and delicate as her own, though free from the prejudices by which
      she is fettered. To Leonora a husband is a lover&mdash;I shall consider
      him as such, and respect her <i>property</i>. You are so little used, my
      dear Gabrielle, to consider a husband in this point of view, that you will
      scarcely enter into my feelings: but put yourself in my situation, allow
      for nationality of principle, and I am persuaded you would act as I shall.
      Spare me your raillery; seriously, if Leonora&rsquo;s husband is in love with
      me, would you not advise me, my dearest friend, to fly him, &ldquo;far as pole
      from pole?&rdquo; Write to me, I conjure you, my Gabrielle&mdash;write
      instantly, and tell me whether R&mdash;&mdash;is now at Paris. I will
      return thither immediately if you advise it. My mind is in such confusion,
      I have no power to decide; I will be guided by your advice.

    <h3>
      MADAME DE P&mdash;&mdash; TO OLIVIA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advice! my charming Olivia! do you ask me for advice? I never gave or took
      advice in my life, except for <i>les vapeurs noirs</i>. And your
      understanding is so far superior to mine, and you comprehend the
      characters of these English so much better than I do, that I cannot
      pretend to counsel you. This Lady Leonora is inconceivable with her
      passion for her own husband; but how ridiculous to let it be suspected! If
      her heart is so tender, cannot she, with all her charms, find a lover on
      whom to bestow it, without tormenting that poor Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;?
      Evidently he is tired of her: and I am sure I should be worn to death were
      I in his place. Nothing so tiresome as love without mystery, and without
      obstacles. And this must ever be the case with conjugal love. Eighteen
      months married, I think you say, and Lady Leonora expects her husband to
      be still at her feet! And she wishes it! Truly she is the most
      unreasonable woman upon earth&mdash;and the most extraordinary; but I am
      tired of thinking of what I cannot comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us pass on to Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;. By your last letters, I should
      judge that he might be an agreeable man, if his wife were out of the
      question. Matrimonial jealousy is a new idea to me; I can judge of it only
      by analogy. In affairs of gallantry, I have sometimes seen one of the
      parties continue to love when the other has become indifferent, and then
      they go on tormenting one another and being miserable, because they have
      not the sense to see that a fire cannot be made of ashes. Sometimes I have
      found romantic young people persuade themselves that they can love no more
      because they can love one another no longer; but if they had sufficient
      courage to say&mdash;I am tired&mdash;and I cannot help it&mdash;they
      would come to a right understanding immediately, and part on the best
      terms possible; each eager to make a new choice, and to be again in love
      and happy. All this to be done with decency, of course. And if there be no
      scandal, where is the harm? Can it signify to the universe whether Mons.
      Un tel likes Madame Une telle or Madame Une autre? Provided there is love
      enough, all the world is in good humour, and that is the essential point;
      for without good humour, what becomes of the pleasures of society? As to
      the rest, I think of inconstancy, or <i>infidelity</i>, as it is called,
      much as our good La Fontaine did&mdash;&ldquo;Quand on le sait, c&rsquo;est peu de
      chose&mdash;quand on ne le sait pas, ce n&rsquo;est rien.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To promise to love one person eternally! What a terrible engagement! It
      freezes my heart even to think of it. I am persuaded, that if I were bound
      to love him for life, I should detest the most amiable man upon earth in
      ten minutes&mdash;a husband more especially. Good heavens! how I should
      abhor M. de P&mdash;&mdash; if I saw him in this point of view! On the
      contrary, now I love him infinitely&mdash;that is to say, as one loves a
      husband. I have his interest at heart, and his glory. When I thought he
      was going to prison I was in despair. I was at home to no one but <i>Brave-et-Tendre</i>,
      and to him only to consult on the means of obtaining my husband&rsquo;s pardon.
      M. de P&mdash;&mdash;is sensible of this, and on my part I have no reason
      to complain of his liberality. We are perfectly happy, though we meet
      perhaps but for a few minutes in the day; and is not this better than
      tiring one another for four-and-twenty hours? When I grow old&mdash;if
      ever I do&mdash;he will be my best friend. In the mean time I support his
      credit with all my influence. This very morning I concluded an affair for
      him, which never could have succeeded, if the intimate friend of the
      minister had not been also my lover. Now, why cannot your Lady Leonora and
      her Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; live on the same sort of terms? But if English
      manners will not permit of this, I have nothing more to say. Above all
      things a woman must respect opinion, else she cannot be well received in
      the world. I conclude this is the secret of Lady Leonora&rsquo;s conduct. But
      then jealousy!&mdash;no woman, I suppose, is bound, even in England, to be
      jealous in order to show her love for her husband. I lose myself again in
      trying to understand what is incomprehensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to you, my dear Olivia, you also amaze me by talking of <i>crimes</i>
      and <i>horror</i>, and <i>flying from pole to pole</i> to avoid a man
      because you have made him at last find out that he has a heart! You have
      done him the greatest possible service: it may preserve him perhaps from
      hanging himself next November&mdash;that month in which, according to
      Voltaire&rsquo;s philosophical calendar, Englishmen always hang themselves,
      because the atmosphere is so thick, and their ennui so heavy. Lady
      Leonora, if she really loves her husband, ought to be infinitely obliged
      to you for averting this danger. As to the rest, your heart is not
      concerned, so you can have nothing to fear; and as for a platonic
      attachment on the part of Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, his wife, even according to
      her own rigid principles, cannot blame you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adieu, my charming friend! Instead of laughing at your fit of prudery, I
      ought to encourage your scruples, that I might profit by them. If they
      should bring you to Paris immediately, with what joy should I embrace my
      Olivia, and how much gratitude should I owe to the jealousy of Lady
      Leonora L&mdash;&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      R&mdash;&mdash; is not yet returned. When I have any news to give you of
      him, depend upon it you shall hear from me again. Accept, my interesting
      Olivia, the vows of my most tender and eternal friendship.

    </h3>
    <p>
      L&mdash;&mdash; Castle, Tuesday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your charming letter, my Gabrielle, has at once revived my spirits and
      dissipated all my scruples; you mistake, however, in supposing that
      Leonora is in love with her husband: more and more reason have I every
      hour to be convinced that Leonora has never known the passion of love;
      consequently her jealousy was, as I at first pronounced it to be, the
      selfish jealousy of matrimonial power and property. Else why does it
      subside, why does it vanish, when, if it were a jealousy of the heart, it
      has now more provocation, infinitely more than when it appeared in full
      force? Leonora could see that her husband distinguished me at a <i>fête
      champêtre</i>; she could see what the eyes of others showed her; she could
      hear what envy whispered, or what scandal hinted; she was mortified, she
      was alarmed even to fainting by a public preference, by a silly country
      girl&rsquo;s mistaking me for <i>the wife</i>, and doing homage to me as to the
      lady of the manor; but Leonora cannot perceive in the object of her
      affection the symptoms that mark the rise and progress of <i>a real love</i>.
      Leonora feels not the little strokes, which would be fatal blows to the
      peace of a truly delicate mind; she heeds not &ldquo;the trifles light as air&rdquo;
       which would be confirmation strong to a soul of genuine sensibility. My
      influence over the mind of L&mdash;&mdash;increases rapidly, and I shall
      let it rise to its acmè before I seem to notice it. Leonora, re-assured, I
      suppose, by a few flattering words, and more, perhaps, by an exalted
      opinion of her own merit, has lately appeared quite at her ease, and blind
      to all that passes before her eyes. It is not for me to dissipate this
      illusion prematurely&mdash;it is not for me to weaken this confidence in
      her husband. To an English wife this would be death. Let her foolish
      security then last as long as possible. After all, how much anguish of
      heart, how many pangs of conscience, how much of the torture of pity, am I
      spared by this callous temper in my friend! I may indulge in a little
      harmless coquetry, without danger to her peace, and without scruple, enjoy
      the dear possession of power.

      &ldquo;Say, for you know,&rdquo; charming Gabrielle, what is the delight of obtaining
      power over the human heart? Let the lords of the creation boast of their
      power to govern all things; to charm these governors be ours. Let the
      logicians of the earth boast their power to regulate the world by reason;
      be it ours, Gabrielle, to intoxicate and humble proud reason to the dust
      beneath our feet.&mdash;And who shall blame in us this ardour for
      universal dominion? If they are men, I call them tyrants&mdash;if they are
      women, I call them hypocrites&mdash;and the two vices which I most detest
      are tyranny and hypocrisy. Frankly I confess, that I feel in all its
      restless activity the passion for general admiration. I cannot conceive&mdash;can
      you, Gabrielle, a pleasure more transporting than the perception of
      extended and extending dominion? The struggle of the rebel heart for
      freedom makes the war more tempting, the victory more glorious, the
      triumph more splendid. Secure of your sympathy, ma belle Gabrielle, I
      shall not fear to tire you by my commentaries.

      Male coquetry justifies female retaliation to any imaginable extent. Upon
      this principle, on which I have seen you act so often, and so
      successfully, I shall now intrepidly proceed. This man makes a show of
      resistance; be it at his own peril: he thinks that he is gaining power
      over my heart, whilst I am preparing torments for his; he fancies that he
      is throwing chains round me, whilst I am rivetting fetters from which he
      will in vain attempt to escape. He is proud, and has the insanity of
      desiring to be exclusively beloved, yet affects to set no value upon the
      preference that is shown to him; appears satisfied with his own
      approbation, and stoically all-sufficient to his own happiness. Leonora
      does not know how to manage his temper, but I do. The suspense, however,
      in which he keeps me is tantalizing: he shall pay for it hereafter: I had
      no idea, till lately, that he had so much self-command. At times he has
      actually made me doubt my own power. At certain moments I have been half
      tempted to believe that I had made no serious impression, that he had been
      only amusing himself at my expense, and for Leonora&rsquo;s gratification: but
      upon careful and cool observation I am convinced that his indifference is
      affected, that all his stoicism will prove vain. The arrow is lodged in
      his heart, and he must fall, whether he turn upon the enemy in anger, or
      fly in dismay.

      My pride is exasperated. I am not accustomed to such obstinate resistance.
      I really almost hate this invincible man, and&mdash;strange inconsistency
      of the human heart!&mdash;almost love him. Heaven and pride preserve me
      from such a weakness! But there is certainly something that piques and
      stimulates one&rsquo;s feelings in this species of male coquetry. L&mdash;&mdash;
      understands the business better than I thought he could. One moment my
      knowledge of the arts of his sex puts me on my guard; the next my
      sensibility exposes me in the most terrible manner. Experience ought to
      protect me, but it only shows me the peril and my inability to escape. Ah!
      Gabrielle, without a heart how safe we should be, how dangerous to our
      lovers! But cursed with sensibility, we must, alas! submit to our fate.
      The habit of loving, <i>le besoin d&rsquo;aimer</i>, is more powerful than all
      sense of the folly and the danger. Nor is the tempest of the passions so
      dreadful as the dead calm of the soul. Why did R&mdash;&mdash; suffer my
      soul to sink into this ominous calm? The fault is his; let him abide the
      consequences. Why did he not follow me to England? why did he not write to
      me? or when he did write, why were his letters so cold, so spiritless?
      When I spoke of divorce, why did he hesitate? Why did he reason when he
      should have only felt? Tell him, my tender, my delicate friend, these are
      questions which the heart asks, and which the heart only can answer.
      Adieu.

    <p>
      Paris.

    <p>
      Je suis excedée! mon coeur. Alive, and but just alive, after such a day of
      fatigues! All morning from one minister to another! then home to my
      toilette! then a great dinner with a number of foreigners, each to be
      distinguished&mdash;then au Feydeau, where I was obliged to go to support
      poor S&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s play. It would be really insupportable, if it were
      not for the finest music in the world, which, after all, the French music
      certainly is. There was a violent party against the piece; and we were so
      late, that it was just on the point of perishing. My ears have not yet
      recovered from the horrid noise. In the midst of the tumult I happily, by
      a master-stroke, turned the fortune of the night. I spied the shawl of an
      English woman hanging over the box. This, you know, like scarlet to the
      bull, is sufficient to enrage the Parisian pit. To the shawl I directed
      the fury of the mob of critics. Luckily for us, the lady was attended only
      by an Englishman, who of course chose to assert his right not to
      understand the customs of any country, or submit to any will but his own.
      He would not permit the shawl to be stirred. À bas! à bas: resounded from
      below. The uproar was inconceivable. You would have thought that the house
      must have come down. In the mean time the piece went on, and the shawl
      covered all its defects. Admire my generalship. T&mdash;&mdash; tells me I
      was born for a general; yet I rather think my forte is negotiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I have not yet come to your affairs, for which alone I could undergo
      the fatigue of writing at this moment. Guess, my Olivia, what apparition I
      met at the door of my box to-night. But the enclosed note will save you
      the trouble of guessing. I could not avoid permitting him to slide his
      billet-doux into my hand as he put on my shawl. Adieu. I must refuse
      myself the pleasure of conversing longer with my sweet friend. Fresh toils
      await me. Madame la Grande will never forgive me if I do not appear for a
      moment at her soirée: and la petite Q&mdash;&mdash; will be jealous beyond
      recovery, if I do not give her a moment: and it is Madame R&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s
      night. There I must be; for all the ambassadors, as usual, will be there;
      and as some of them, I have reason to believe, go on purpose to meet me, I
      cannot disappoint their Excellencies. My friends would never forgive it. I
      am positively quite weary of this life of eternal bustle; but once in the
      eddy, one is carried round and round; there is no stopping. Adieu, adieu.
      I write under the hands of Victoire. O that she had your taste to guide
      her, and to decide my too vacillating judgment! we should then have no
      occasion to dread even the elegant simplicity of Madame R&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s
      toilette.

      My Gabrielle, I have read R&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s note enclosed in your charming
      sprightly letter. What a contrast! So cold! so formal! A thousand times
      rather would I not have heard from him, than have received a letter so
      little in unison with my feelings. He talks to me of business. Business!
      What business ought to detain a man a moment from the woman he loves? The
      interests of his ambition are nothing to me. What are all these to love?
      Is he so mean as to hesitate between them? then I despise him! and Olivia
      can never love the being she despises!
    </p>
    <p>
      Does R&mdash;&mdash; flatter himself that his power over my heart is
      omnipotent? Does he imagine that Olivia is to be slighted with impunity?
      Does R&mdash;&mdash; think that a woman, who has even nominally the honour
      to reign over his heart, cannot meditate new conquests? Oh, credulous
      vanity of man! He fancies, perhaps, that he is secure of the maturer age
      of one, who fondly devoted to him her inexperienced youth. &ldquo;Security is
      the curse of fools.&rdquo; Does he in his wisdom deem a woman&rsquo;s age a sufficient
      pledge for her constancy? He might every day see examples enough to
      convince him of his error. In fact, the age of women has nothing to do
      with the number of their years. Possibly, however, the gallant gentleman
      may be of opinion with Leonora&rsquo;s Swiss, that Lady Olivia is <i>un peu
      passée</i>. Adieu, my dear friend; you, who always understand and
      sympathize in my feelings, you will express them for me in the best manner
      possible. I shall not write to R&mdash;&mdash;. You will see him; and

      love&mdash;her just resentment.

      Pity me, dearest Gabrielle, for I am in need of all the pity which your
      susceptible heart can bestow. Never was woman in such a terrible
      situation! Yes, Gabrielle, this provoking, this incomprehensible, this too
      amiable man, has entangled your poor friend past recovery. Her sentiments
      and sensations must henceforward be in eternal opposition to each other.
      Friendship, gratitude, honour, virtue, all in tremendous array, forbid her
      to think of love; but love, imperious love, will not be so defied: he
      seizes upon his victim, and now, as in all the past, will be the ruler,
      the tyrant of Olivia&rsquo;s destiny. Never was confusion, amazement, terror,
      remorse, equal to mine, Gabrielle, when I first discovered that I loved
      him. Who could have foreseen, who could have imagined it? I meant but to
      satisfy an innocent curiosity, to indulge harmless coquetry, to gratify
      the natural love of admiration, and to enjoy the possession of power.
      Alas! I felt not that, whilst I was acquiring ascendancy over the heart of
      another, I was beguiled of all command over my own. I flattered myself
      that, when honour should bid me stop, I could pause without hesitation,
      without effort: I promised myself, that the moment I should discover that
      I was loved by the husband of my friend I should fly from him for ever.
      Alas! it is no longer time&mdash;to fly from him is no longer in my power.
      Oh. Gabrielle! I love him: he knows that I love him. Never did woman
      suffer more than I have done since I wrote to you last. The conflict was
      too violent for my feeble frame. I have been ill&mdash;very ill: a nervous
      fever brought me nearly to the grave. Why did I not die? I should have
      escaped the deep humiliation, the endless self-reproach to which my future
      existence is doomed.&mdash;Leonora!&mdash;Why do I start at that name? Oh!
      there is horror in the sound! Even now perhaps she knows and triumphs in
      my weakness. Even now, perhaps, her calm insensible soul blesses itself
      for not being made like mine. Even now perhaps her husband doubts whether
      he shall accept Olivia&rsquo;s love, or sacrifice your wretched friend to
      Leonora&rsquo;s pride. Oh, Gabrielle, no words can describe what I suffer! But I
      must be calm, and explain the progress of this fatal passion. Explain&mdash;Heavens!
      how shall I explain what I cannot recollect without heart-rending anguish
      and confusion! Oh, Gabrielle! pity

      My dear romantic Olivia! you must have a furious passion for tormenting
      yourself, when you can find matter for despair in your present situation.
      In your place I should rejoice to find that in the moment an old passion
      had consumed itself, a new one, fresh and vigorous, springs from its
      ashes. My charming friend, understand your own interests, and do not be
      the dupe of those fine phrases that we are obliged to employ to deceive
      others. Rail at Cupid as much as you please to the men in public, <i>par
      façon</i>; but always remember for your private use, that love is
      essential to our existence in society. What is a woman when she neither
      loves nor is loved? a mere <i>personage muet</i> in the drama of life. Is
      it not from our lovers that we derive our consequence? Even a beauty
      without lovers is but a queen without subjects. A woman who renounces love
      is an abdicated sovereign, always longing to resume her empire when it is
      too late; continually forgetting herself, like the pseudo-philosophic
      Christina, talking and acting as though she had still the power of life
      and death in her hands; a tyrant without guards or slaves; a most awkward,
      pitiable, and ridiculous personage. No, my fair Olivia, let us never
      abjure love; even when the reign of beauty passes away, that of grace and
      sentiment remains. As much delicacy as you please: without delicacy there
      is no grace, and without a veil, beauty loses her most captivating charms.
      I pity you, my dear, for having let your veil be blown aside <i>malheureusement</i>.
      But such accidents will happen. Who can control the passions or the winds?
      After all, <i>l&rsquo;erreur d&rsquo;un moment</i> is not irretrievable, and you
      reproach yourself too bitterly, my sweet friend, for your involuntary
      injustice to Lady Leonora. Assuredly it could not be your intention to
      sacrifice your repose to Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;. You loved him against your
      will, did you not? And it is, you know, by the intention that we must
      judge of actions: the positive harm done to the world in general is in all
      cases the only just measure of criminality. Now what harm is done to the
      universe, and what injury can accrue to any individual, provided you keep
      your own counsel? As long as your friend is deceived, she is happy; it
      therefore becomes your duty, your virtue, to dissemble. I am no great
      casuist, but all this appears to me self-evident; and these I always
      thought were your principles of philosophy. My dear Olivia, I have drawn
      out my whole store of metaphysics with some difficulty for your service; I
      flatter myself I have set your poor distracted head to rights. One word
      more&mdash;for I like to go to the bottom of a subject, when I can do so
      in two minutes: virtue is desirable because it makes us happy;
      consequently, to make ourselves happy is to be truly virtuous. Methinks
      this is sound logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      To tell you the truth, my dear Olivia, I do not well conceive how you have
      contrived to fall in love with this half-frozen Englishman. &lsquo;Tis done,
      however&mdash;there is no arguing against facts; and this is only one
      proof more of what I have always maintained, that destiny is inevitable
      and love irresistible. Voltaire&rsquo;s charming inscription on the statue of
      Cupid is worth all the volumes of reasoning and morality that ever were or
      ever will be written. Banish melancholy thoughts, my dear friend; they
      serve no manner of purpose but to increase your passion. Repentance
      softens the heart; and every body knows, that what softens the heart
      disposes it more to love: for which reason I never abandon myself to this
      dangerous luxury of repentance. Mon Dieu! why will people never benefit by
      experience? And to what purpose do they read history? Was not La Vallière
      ever penitent, and ever transgressing? ever in transports or in tears?
      You, at all events, my Olivia, can never become a Carmelite or a Magdalen.
      You have emancipated yourself from superstition: but whilst you ridicule
      all religious orders, do not inflict upon yourself their penances. The
      habit of some of the orders has been thought becoming. The modest costume
      of a nun is indeed one of the prettiest dresses one can wear at a
      masquerade ball, and it might even be worn without a mask, if it were
      fashionable: but nothing that is not fashionable can be becoming.

    <p>
      Adieu, my adorable Olivia: I will send you, by the first opportunity, your
      Lyons gown, which is really charming.

      LETTER XXXIX.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      OLIVIA TO MADAME DE P&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Nov. 30th, &mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Your truly philosophical letter, my infinitely various Gabrielle, infused
      a portion of its charming spirit into my soul. My mind was fortified and
      elevated by your eloquence. Who could think that a woman of such a lively
      genius could be so profound? and who could expect from a woman who has
      passed her life in the world, such original and deep reflections? You see
      you were mistaken when you thought that you had no genius for philosophic
      subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all that has been said by metaphysicians about the existence and
      seat of the moral sense, I think I can solve every difficulty by a new
      theory. You know some philosophers suppose the moral sense to be intuitive
      and inherent in man: others who deny the doctrine of innate ideas, treat
      this notion of innate sentiments as equally absurd. There they certainly
      are wrong, for sentiments are widely different from ideas, and I have that
      within me which convinces my understanding that sentiments must be innate,
      and proportioned to the delicacy of our sensibility; no person of common
      sense or feeling can doubt this. But there are other points which I own
      puzzled me till yesterday: some metaphysicians would seat the moral sense
      inherently in the heart, others would place it intuitively in the brain,
      all would confine it to the soul; now in my opinion it resides primarily
      and principally in the nerves, and varies with their variations. Hence the
      difficulty of making the moral sense a universal guide of action, since it
      not only differs in many individuals, but in the same persons at different
      periods of their existence, or (as I have often experienced) at different
      hours of the day. All this must depend upon the mobility of the nervous
      system: upon this may <i>hinge</i> the great difficulties which have
      puzzled metaphysicians respecting consciousness, identity, &amp;c. If they
      had attended less to the nature of the soul, and more to the system of the
      nerves, they would have avoided innumerable errors, and probably would
      have made incalculably important discoveries. Nothing is wanting but some
      great German genius to bring this idea of a moral sense in the nerves into
      fashion. Indeed, if our friend Mad. &mdash;&mdash; would mention it in the
      notes to her new novel, it would introduce it, in the most satisfactory
      manner possible, to all the fashionable world abroad; and we take our
      notions in this country implicitly from the continent. As for you, my dear
      Gabrielle, I know you cut the Gordian knot at once, by referring, with
      your favourite moralist, every principle of human nature to self-love.
      This does not quite accord with my ideas; there is something harsh in it
      that is repugnant to my sensibility; but you have a stronger mind than I
      have, and perhaps your theory is right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell me I contradict myself continually,&rdquo; says the acute and witty
      Duke de la Rochefoucault: &ldquo;No, but the human heart, of which I treat, is
      in perpetual contradiction to itself.&rdquo; Permit me to avail myself of this
      answer, dear Gabrielle, if you should accuse me of contradicting in this
      letter all that I said to you in my last. A few hours after I had
      despatched it, the state of my nerves changed; I saw things of course in a
      new light, and repented having exposed myself to your raillery by writing
      in such a Magdalen strain. My nerves were more in fault than I. When one&rsquo;s
      mind, or one&rsquo;s nerves grow weak, the early associations and old prejudices
      of the nursery recur, and tyrannize over one&rsquo;s reason: from this evil your
      liberal education and enviable temperament have preserved you; but have
      charity for my feminine weakness of frame, which too often counteracts the
      masculine strength of my soul. Now that I have deprecated your ridicule
      for my last nervous nonsense, I will go on in a more rational manner.
      However my better judgment might have been clouded for a moment, I have
      recovered strength of mind enough to see that I am in no way to blame for
      any thing that has happened. If a man is amiable, and if I have taste and
      sensibility, I must see and feel it. &ldquo;To love,&rdquo; as I remember your friend
      G&mdash;&mdash; once finely observed to you, &ldquo;to love, is a crime only in
      the eyes of demons, or of priests, who resemble demons.&rdquo; This is a general
      proposition, to which none but the prejudiced can refuse their assent: and
      what is true in general, must be true in particular. The <i>accident</i>,
      I use the term philosophically, not popularly, the accident of a man&rsquo;s
      being married, or, in other words, having entered imprudently into a
      barbarous and absurd civil contract, cannot alter the nature of things.
      The essence of truth cannot be affected by the variation of external
      circumstances. Now the proper application of metaphysics frees the mind
      from vulgar prejudices, and dissipates the baby terrors of an ill-educated
      conscience. To fall in love with a married man, and the husband of your
      intimate friend! How dreadful this sounds to some ears! even mine were
      startled at first, till I called reason to my assistance. Then I had
      another difficulty to combat&mdash;to own, and own unasked, a passion to
      the object of it, would shock the false delicacy of those who are governed
      by common forms, and who are slaves to vulgar prejudices: but a little
      philosophy liberates our sex from the tyranny of custom, teaches us to
      disdain hypocrisy, and to glory in the simplicity of truth.

    <p>
      Josephine had been perfuming my hair, and I was sitting reading at my
      toilette; the door of my dressing-room happened to be half open; L&mdash;&mdash;
      was crossing the gallery, and as he passed I suppose his eye was caught by
      my hair, or perhaps he paused a moment, I am not certain how it was&mdash;my
      eyes were on my book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! vous avez raison, monsieur, c&rsquo;est la plus belle chevelure! Mais
      entrez donc, monsieur,&rdquo; cried Josephine, whom I can never teach to
      comprehend or respect English customs, &ldquo;Eh! entrez, entrez, monsieur;
      madame est à sa toilette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I looked up I could not forbear smiling at the extreme ease and
      decision of Josephine&rsquo;s manner, and the excessive doubt and anxiety in the
      gentleman&rsquo;s appearance. My smile, which, Heaven knows, meant no
      encouragement, decided him; timidity instantly gave way to joy; he
      entered. What was to be done? I could not turn him out again; I was not
      answerable for any foolish conclusions he might draw, from what he ought
      in politeness to have considered as a thing of course. All I could do was
      to blame Josephine for being a French woman. To defend her, and flatter
      me, was the gentleman&rsquo;s part; and, for an Englishman, he really acquitted
      himself with tolerable grace. Josephine at least was pleased, and she
      found such a perpetual employment for monsieur, and his advice was so
      necessary, that there was no chance of his departure: so we talked of
      French <i>toilettes</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c. in French, for Josephine&rsquo;s
      edification: L&mdash;&mdash; paid me some compliments upon the recovery of
      my looks after my illness&mdash;I thought I looked terribly languid&mdash;but
      he assured me that this languor, in his eyes, was an additional grace; I
      could not understand this: he fancied that must be because he did not
      express himself well in French; he explained himself more clearly in
      English, which Josephine, you know, does not understand, so that she was
      now forced to be silent, and I was compelled to take my share in the
      conversation. L&mdash;&mdash; made me comprehend, that languor, indicating
      sensibility of heart, was to him the most touching of female charms; I
      sighed, and took up the book I had been reading; it was the new novel
      which you sent me, dear Gabrielle; I talked of it, in hopes of changing
      the course of the conversation; alas! this led to one far more dangerous:
      he looked at the passage I had been reading. This brought us back to
      sensibility again&mdash;to sentiments and descriptions so terribly
      apposite! we found such a similarity in our tastes! Yet L&mdash;&mdash;
      spoke only in general, and he preserved a command over himself, which
      provoked me, though I knew it to be coquetry; I saw the struggle in his
      mind, and was determined to force him to be candid, and to enjoy my
      triumph. With these views I went farther than I had intended. The charm of
      sensibility he had told me was to him irresistible. Alas! I let him
      perceive all the weakness of my heart.&mdash;Sensibility is the worst
      time-keeper in the world. We were neither of us aware of its progressive
      motion. The Swiss&mdash;my evil genius&mdash;the Swiss knocked at the door
      to let me know dinner was served. Dinner! on what vulgar incidents the
      happiness of life depends! Dinner came between the discovery of my
      sentiments and that declaration of passion which I now must hear&mdash;or
      die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le diner! mon Dieu!&rdquo; cried Josephine. &ldquo;Mais&mdash;finissons donc&mdash;la
      toilette de madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I heard the impertinent Swiss at the other end of the gallery at his
      master&rsquo;s door, wondering in broken English where his master could be, and
      conjecturing forty absurdities about his boots, and his being out riding,
      &amp;c. &amp;c. To sally forth in conscious innocence upon the enemy&rsquo;s
      spies, and to terminate the adventure as it was begun, <i>à la Françoise</i>,
      was my resolution. L&mdash;&mdash; and Josephine understood me perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! Monsieur de Vaud,&rdquo; said Josephine to the Swiss, whom we met on the
      landing-place of the stairs, &ldquo;madame n&rsquo;est elle pas coeffée à ravir
      aujourd&rsquo;hui? C&rsquo;est que monsieur vient d&rsquo;assister à la toilette de madame.&rdquo;
       The Swiss bowed, and said nothing. The bow was to his master, not to me,
      and it was a bow of duty, not of inclination. I never saw a man look so
      like a machine; he did not even raise his eyes upon me or my <i>coëffure</i>
      as we passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; cried Josephine, with an inexpressible accent of mingled
      indignation and contempt. She ran down stairs, leaving the Swiss to his
      stupidity. I was more afraid of his penetration. But I entered the
      dining-room as if nothing extraordinary had happened; and after all, you
      know, my dear Gabrielle, nothing extraordinary had befallen us. A
      gentleman had assisted at a lady&rsquo;s toilette. Nothing more simple, nothing,
      more proper in the meridian of Paris; and does propriety change with
      meridians? There was company at dinner, and the conversation was general
      and uninteresting; L&mdash;&mdash; endeavoured to support his part with
      vivacity; but he had fits of absence and silence, which might have alarmed
      Leonora, if she had any suspicion. But she is now perfectly secure, and
      absolutely blind: therefore you see there can be no danger for her
      happiness in my remaining where I am. For no earthly consideration would I
      disturb her peace of mind; there is no sacrifice I would hesitate for a
      moment to make to friendship or virtue, but I cannot surely be called upon
      to <i>plant a dagger in my own heart</i> to destroy, for ever to destroy
      my own felicity without advantage to my friend. My attachment to L&mdash;&mdash;,
      as you say, is involuntary, and my love as pure as it is fervent. I have
      reason to believe that his sentiments are the same for me; but of this I
      am not yet certain. There is the danger, and the only real danger for
      Leonora&rsquo;s happiness; for whilst this uncertainty and his consequent fits
      of absence and imprudence last, there is hazard every moment of her being
      alarmed. But when L&mdash;&mdash; once decides, every thing arranges
      itself, you know, Gabrielle, and prudence becomes a duty to ourselves and
      to Leonora. No word, or look, or coquetry could then escape us; we should
      be unpardonable if we did not conduct ourselves with the most scrupulous
      delicacy and attention to her feelings. I am amazed that L&mdash;&mdash;,
      who has really a good understanding, does not make these reflections, and
      is not determined by this calculation. For his, for my own, but most for
      Leonora&rsquo;s sake, I wish that this cruel suspense were at an end. Adieu,
      dear and amiable Gabrielle.&mdash;These things are managed better in
      France.

    <h3>
      MRS. C&mdash;&mdash; TO MISS B&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      DEAR MARGARET, L&mdash;&mdash; Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I arrived here late yesterday evening in high spirits, and high hopes of
      surprising and delighting all the world by my unexpected appearance; but
      my pride was checked, and my tone changed the moment I saw Leonora. Never
      was any human being so altered in her looks in so short a time. I had
      just, and but just presence of mind enough not to say so. I am astonished
      that it does not strike Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;. As soon as she left the room,
      I asked him if Lady Leonora had been ill? No; perfectly well! perfectly
      well!&mdash;Did not he perceive that she looked extremely ill? No; she
      might be paler than usual: that was all that Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; had
      observed. Lady Olivia, after a pause, added, that Leonora certainly had
      not appeared well lately, but this was nothing extraordinary in her <i>situation</i>.
      <i>Situation!</i> nonsense! Lady Olivia went on with sentimental hypocrisy
      of look and tone, saying fine things, to which I paid little attention.
      Virtue in words, and vice in actions! thought I. People, of certain
      pretensions in the court of sentiment, think that they can pass false
      virtues upon the world for real, as some ladies, entitled by their rank to
      wear jewels, appear in false stones, believing that it will be taken for
      granted they would wear nothing but diamonds. Not one eye in a hundred
      detects the difference at first, but in time the hundredth eye comes, and
      then they must for ever hide their diminished rays. Beware! Lady Olivia,
      beware!
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonora is ill, or unhappy, or both; but she will not allow that she is
      either. On one subject she is impenetrable: a hundred, a thousand
      different ways within these four-and-twenty hours have I led to it, with
      all the ingenuity and all the delicacy of which I am mistress; but all to
      no purpose. Neither by provocation, persuasion, laughing, teazing,
      questioning, cross, or round about, pushing, squeezing, encompassing,
      taking for granted, wondering, or blundering, could I gain my point. Every
      look guarded&mdash;every syllable measured&mdash;yet unequivocal&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;She said no more than just the thing she ought.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Because I could find no fault, I was half angry. I respect the motive of
      this reserve; but towards me it is misplaced, and ill-judged, and it must
      not exist. I have often declared that I would never condescend to play the
      part of a confidante to any princess or heroine upon earth. But Leonora is
      neither princess nor heroine, and I would be her confidante, but she will
      not let me. Now I am punished for my pride. If she would only trust me, if
      she would only tell me what has passed since I went, and all that now
      weighs upon her mind, I could certainly be of some use. I could and would
      say every thing that she might scruple to hint to Lady Olivia, and I will
      answer for it I would make her raise the siege. But I cannot believe Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;
      to be such a madman as to think of attaching himself seriously to a woman
      like Olivia, when he has such a wife as Leonora. That he was amusing
      himself with Olivia I saw, or thought I saw, some time ago, and I rather
      wondered that Leonora was uneasy: for all husbands will flirt, and all
      wives must bear it, thought I. When such a coquette as this fell in his
      way, and made advances, he would have been more than man if he had
      receded. Of course, I thought, he must despise and laugh at her all the
      time he was flattering and gallanting her ladyship. This would have been
      fair play, and comic; but the comedy should have ended by this time. I am
      now really afraid it will turn into a tragedy. I, even I! am alarmed. I
      must prevail upon Leonora to speak to me without reserve. I see her
      suffer, and I must share her grief. Have not I always done so from the
      time we were children? and now, when she most wants a friend, am not I
      worthy to share her confidence? Can she mistake friendship for impertinent
      curiosity? Does not she know that I would not be burthened with the
      secrets of any body whom I did not love? If she thinks otherwise, she does
      me injustice, and I will tell her so before I sleep. She does not know how
      well I love her.

      My dear Margaret, Leonora and I have had a quarrel&mdash;the first serious
      quarrel we ever had in our lives; and the end of it is, that she is an
      angel, and I am a fool. Just as I laid down my pen after writing to you,
      though it was long past midnight, I marched into Leonora&rsquo;s apartment,
      resolved to surprise or to force her confidence. I found her awake, as I
      expected, and up and dressed, as I did not expect, sitting in her
      dressing-room, her head leaning upon her hand. I knew what she was
      thinking of; she had a heap of Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s old letters beside
      her. She denied that she was in tears, and I will not swear to the tears,
      but I think I saw signs of them notwithstanding. I spoke out;&mdash;but in
      vain&mdash;all in vain. At last I flew into a passion, and reproached her
      bitterly. She answered me with that air of dignified tenderness which is
      peculiar to her&mdash;&ldquo;If you believe me to be unhappy, my dear Helen, is
      this a time to reproach me unjustly?&rdquo; I was brought to reason and to
      tears, and after asking pardon, like a foolish naughty child, was kissed
      and forgiven, upon a promise never to do so any more; a promise which I
      hope Heaven will grant me grace and strength of mind enough to keep. I was
      certainly wrong to attempt to force her secret from her. Leonora&rsquo;s
      confidence is always given, never yielded; and in her, openness is a
      virtue, not a weakness. But I wish she would not contrive to be always in
      the right. In all our quarrels, in all the variations of my humour, I am
      obliged to end by doing homage to her reason, as the Chinese mariners, in
      every change of weather, burn incense before the needle.

    </p>
    <p>
      I hoped that you would have favoured us with a passing visit in your way
      from town, but I know you will tell me that friendship must not interfere
      with the interests of the service. I have reason to curse those interests;
      they are for ever at variance with mine. I had a particular desire to
      speak to you upon a subject, on which it is not agreeable to me to write.
      Lady Leonora also wished extremely, and disinterestedly, for your company.
      She does not know how much she is obliged to you. The laconic advice you
      gave me, some time ago, influenced my conduct longer, than counsel which
      is in opposition to our passions usually does, and it has haunted my
      imagination perpetually:&mdash;&ldquo;My dear L&mdash;&mdash;, do not end by
      being the dupe of a <i>Frenchified coquette</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My dear friend, of that there is no danger. No man upon earth despises or
      detests coquettes more than I do, be they French or English. I think,
      however, that a foreign-born, or foreign-bred coquette, has more of the
      ease of <i>practice</i>, and less of the awkwardness of conscience, than a
      home-bred flirt, and is in reality less blamable, for she breaks no
      restraints of custom or education; she does only what she has seen her
      mother do before her, and what is authorized by the example of most of the
      fashionable ladies of her acquaintance. But let us put flirts and
      coquettes quite out of the question. My dear general, you know that I am
      used to women, and take it upon my word, that the lady to whom I allude is
      more tender and passionate than vain. Every woman has, or has had, a
      tincture of vanity; but there are a few, and those are to me the most
      amiable of the sex, who
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Feel every vanity in fondness lost.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      You know that I am delicate, even fastidious, in my taste for female
      manners. Nothing can in my opinion make amends for any offence against
      propriety, except it be sensibility&mdash;genuine, generous sensibility.
      This can, in my mind, cover a multitude of faults. There is so much of
      selfishness, of hypocrisy, of coldness, in what is visually called female
      virtue, that I often turn with distaste from those to whom I am compelled
      to do homage, for the sake of the general good of society. I am not <i>charlatan</i>
      enough to pretend upon all occasions to prefer the public advantage to my
      own. I confess, that let a woman be ever so fair, or good, or wise:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Be she with that goodness blest
  Which may merit name of best,
  If she be not such to me,
  What care I how good she be?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And I will further acknowledge, that I am not easily satisfied with the
      manner in which a woman is kind to me: if it be duty-work kindness, I
      would not give thanks for it: it is done for her reputation, not for me,
      and let the world thank her. To <i>the best of wives</i>, I should make
      the worst of husbands. No&mdash;I should, I hope, pay her in her own coin,
      with all due observances, attentions, and respect, but without one grain
      of love. Love is only to be had for love; and without it, nothing a woman
      can give appears to me worth having. I do not desire to be loved well
      enough to satisfy fathers and mothers, and uncles and aunts; well enough
      to decide a woman to marry me rather than disoblige her friends, or run
      the chance of having <i>many a worse offer</i>, and living perhaps to be
      an old maid. I do not desire to be loved well enough to keep a woman true
      and faithful to me &ldquo;<i>till death us do part</i>:&rdquo; in short, I do not
      desire to be loved well enough for a husband; I desire to be loved
      sufficiently for a lover; not only above all other persons, but above all
      other things, all other considerations&mdash;to be the first and last
      object in the heart of the woman to whom I am attached: I wish to feel
      that I sustain and fill the whole of her heart. I must be certain that I
      am every thing to her, as she is every thing to me; that there is no
      imaginable situation in which she would not live with me, in which she
      would not be happy to live with me; no possible sacrifice that she would
      not make for me; or rather, that nothing she could do should appear a
      sacrifice. Are these exorbitant expectations? I am capable of all this,
      and more, for a woman I love; and it is my pride or my misfortune to be
      able to love upon no other terms. Such proofs of attachment it may be
      difficult to obtain, and even to give; more difficult, I am sensible, for
      a wife than for a mistress. A young lady who is married <i>secundum artem</i>,
      with licence and consent of friends, can give no extraordinary instances
      of affection. I should not consider it as an indisputable proof of love,
      that she does me the honour to give me her hand in a church, or that she
      condescends to bespeak my liveries, or to be handed into her own coach
      with all the blushing honours of a bride; all the paraphernalia of a wife
      secured, all the prudent and necessary provision made both for matrimonial
      love and hatred, dower, pin-money, and separate maintenance on the one
      hand, and on the other, lands, tenements, and hereditaments for the future
      son and heir, and sums without end for younger children to the tenth and
      twentieth possibility, <i>as the case may be, nothing herein contained to
      the contrary in any wise notwithstanding</i>. Such a jargon Cupid does not
      understand. A woman may love this most convenient personage, her lawful
      husband; but I should think it difficult for the delicacy of female
      passion to survive the cool preparations for hymeneal felicity. At all
      events, you will allow the lady makes no sacrifice, she shows no great
      generosity, and she may, or she may not, be touched at the altar by the
      divine flame. My good general, when you are a husband you will feel these
      things as I do; till then, it is very easy to talk as you do, and to
      admire other men&rsquo;s wives, and to wish Heaven had blessed you with such a
      treasure. For my part, the single idea, that a woman thinks it her duty to
      be fond of me, would deprive me of all pleasure in her love. No man can be
      more sensible than I am of the amiable and estimable qualities of Lady
      Leonora L&mdash;&mdash;; I should be a brute and a liar if I hesitated to
      give the fullest testimony in her praise; but such is the infirmity of my
      nature, that I could pardon some faults more easily, than I could like
      some virtues. The virtues which leave me in doubt of a woman&rsquo;s love, I can
      esteem, but that is all. Lady Leonora is calm, serene, perfectly
      sweet-tempered, without jealousy and without suspicion; in one word,
      without love. If she loved me, she never could have been the wife she has
      been for some months past. You will laugh at my being angry with a wife
      for not being jealous. But so it is. Certain defects of temper I could
      bear, if I considered them as symptoms of strong affection. When I for a
      moment believed that Leonora suffered, when I attributed her fainting at
      our fête champêtre to jealousy, I was so much alarmed and touched, that I
      absolutely forgot her rival. I did more; to prevent her feeling
      uneasiness, to destroy the suspicions which I imagined had been awakened
      in her mind, I hesitated not to sacrifice all the pleasure and all the
      vanity which a man of my age might reasonably be supposed to feel in the
      prospect of a new and not inglorious conquest; I left home immediately,
      and went to meet you, my dear friend, on your return from abroad. This
      visit I do not set down to your account, but to that of honour&mdash;foolish,
      unnecessary honour. You half-persuaded me, that your hearsay Parisian
      evidence was more to be trusted than my own judgment, and I returned home
      with the resolution not to be the dupe of a coquette. Leonora&rsquo;s reception
      of me was delightful; I never saw her in such spirits, or so amiable. But
      I could not help wishing to ascertain whether I had attributed her
      fainting to the real cause. This proof I tempted to my cost. Instead of
      showing any tender alarm at the renewal of my obvious attentions to her
      rival, she was perfectly calm and collected, went on with her usual
      occupations, fulfilled all her duties, never reproached me by word or
      look, never for one moment betrayed impatience, ill-humour, suspicion, or
      jealousy; in short, I found that I had been fool enough to attribute to
      excess of affection, an accident which proceeded merely from the situation
      of her health. If anxiety of mind had been the cause of her fainting at
      the fête champêtre, she would since have felt and shown agitation on a
      thousand occasions, where she has been perfectly tranquil. Her friend Mrs.
      C&mdash;&mdash;, who returned here a few days ago, seems to imagine that
      Leonora looks ill; but I shall not again be led to mistake bodily
      indisposition for mental suffering. Leonora&rsquo;s conduct argues great
      insensibility of soul, or great command; great insensibility, I think: for
      I cannot imagine such command of temper possible to any, but a woman who
      feels indifference for the offender. Yet, even now that I have steeled
      myself with this conviction, I am scarcely bold enough to hazard the
      chance of giving her pain. Absurd weakness! It has been clearly proved to
      my understanding, that my irresolution, my scruples of conscience, my
      combats between love and esteem, are more likely to betray the real state
      of my mind than any decision that I could make. I decide, then&mdash;I
      determine to be happy with a woman who has a soul capable of feeling, not
      merely what is called conjugal affection, but the passion of love; who is
      capable of sacrificing every thing to love; who has given me proofs of
      candour and greatness of mind, which I value far above all her wit, grace,
      and beauty. My dear general, I know all that you can tell, all that you
      can hint concerning her history abroad. I know it from her own lips. It
      was told to me in a manner that made her my admiration. It was told to me
      as a preservative against the danger of loving her. It was told to me with
      the generous design of protecting Leonora&rsquo;s happiness; and all this at the
      moment when I was beloved, tenderly beloved. She is above dissimulation:
      she scorns the arts, the fears of her sex. She knows you are her enemy,
      and yet she esteems you; she urged me to speak to you with the utmost
      openness: &ldquo;Let me never,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;be the cause of your feeling less
      confidence or less affection for the best of friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      R&mdash;&mdash; is sacrificed to me; that R&mdash;&mdash;, with whose
      cursed name you tormented me. My dear friend, she will force your
      admiration, as she has won my love.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I am not trusted with the secret, I may, my dear Margaret, use my own
      eyes and ears as I please to find it out; and I know Leonora&rsquo;s countenance
      so well, that I see every thing that passes in her mind, just as clearly
      as if she had told it to me in words.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grieves me, more than I can express, to see her suffering as she does.
      I am now convinced that she has reason to be unhappy; and what is worse, I
      do not see what course she can follow to recover her happiness. All her
      forbearance, all her patience, all her sweet temper, I perceive, are
      useless, or worse than useless, injurious to her in her strange husband&rsquo;s
      opinion. I never liked him thoroughly, and now I detest him. He thinks her
      cold, insensible! She insensible!&mdash;Brute! Idiot! Every thing that she
      says or does displeases him. The merest trifles excite the most cruel
      suspicions. He totally misunderstands her character, and sees every thing
      about her in a false light. In short, he is under the dominion of an
      artful fiend, who works as she pleases upon his passions&mdash;upon his
      pride, which is his ruling passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This evening Lady Olivia began confessing that she had too much
      sensibility, that she was of an excessively susceptible temper, and that
      she should be terribly jealous of the affections of any person she loved.
      She did not know how love <i>could</i> exist without jealousy. Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;
      was present, and listening eagerly. Leonora&rsquo;s lips were silent; not so her
      countenance. I was in hopes Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; would have remarked its
      beautiful touching expression; but his eyes were fixed upon Olivia. I
      could have ... but let me go on. Lady Olivia had the malice suddenly to
      appeal to Leonora, and asked whether she was never jealous of her husband?
      Leonora, astonished by her assurance, paused for an instant, and then
      replied, &ldquo;It would be difficult to convince me that I had any reason to be
      jealous of Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, I esteem him so much.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I wish to
      Heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Olivia, her eyes turned upwards with a fine St.
      Cecilia expression, whilst Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s attention was fixed upon
      her, &ldquo;Would to Heaven I was blessed with such a <i>reasonable</i> temper!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;When
      you are wishing to Heaven, Lady Olivia,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;had not you better ask
      for <i>all you want</i> at once; not only such a reasonable temper, but
      such a feeling heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some of the company smiled. Lady Olivia, practised as she is, looked
      disconcerted; Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; grave and impenetrable; Leonora,
      blushing, turned away to the piano-forte. Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; remained
      talking with Lady Olivia, and he neither saw nor heard her. If Leonora had
      sung like an angel, it would have made no impression. She turned over the
      leaves of her music quickly, to a lively air, and played it immediately,
      to prevent my perceiving how much she felt. Poor Leonora! you are but a
      bad dissembler, and it is in vain to try to conceal yourself from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was so sorry for her, and so incensed with Olivia this night, that I
      could not restrain myself, and I made matters worse. At supper I came
      almost to open war with her ladyship. I cannot remember exactly what I
      said, but I know that I threw out the most severe inuendoes which
      politeness could permit: and what <i>was</i> the consequence? Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;
      pitied Olivia and hated me; Leonora was in misery the whole time; and her
      husband probably thought that she was the instigator, though she was
      perfectly innocent. My dear Margaret, where will all this end? and how
      much more mischief shall I do with the best intentions possible?

    </p>
    <p>
      Leonora feels not&mdash;sees not: she requires, she excites no pity. Long

      cause have I for remorse? &ldquo;Who is most to blame, he who ceases to love, or
      she who ceases to please?&rdquo; Leonora perhaps thinks that she loves her
      husband; and no doubt she does so in a conjugal sort of a way: he <i>has</i>
      loved his wife; but be it mine to prove that his heart is suited to far

    <p>
      What the devil would you have of your wife, my dear L&mdash;&mdash;? You
      would be loved above all earthly considerations; honour, duty, virtue, and
      religion inclusive, would you? and you would have a wife with her head in
      the clouds, would you? I wish you were married to one of the all-for-love
      heroines, who would treat you with bowl and dagger every day of your life.
      In your opinion sensibility covers a multitude of faults&mdash;you would
      have said <i>sins</i>: so it had need, for it produces a multitude. Pray
      what brings hundreds and thousands of women to the Piazzas of Covent
      Garden but sensibility? What does the colonel&rsquo;s, and the captain&rsquo;s, and
      the ensign&rsquo;s mistress talk of but <i>sensibility</i>? And are you, my dear
      friend, to be duped by this hackneyed word? And should you really think it
      an indisputable proof of a lady&rsquo;s love, that she would jump out of a two
      pair of stairs window into your arms? Now I should think myself sure of
      such a woman&rsquo;s love only just whilst I held her, and scarcely then; for I,
      who in my own way am jealous as well as yourself, should in this case be
      jealous of wickedness, and should strongly suspect that she would love the
      first devil that she saw better than me.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are always raving about sacrifices. Your Cupid must be a very
      vindictive little god. Mine is a good-humoured, rosy little fellow, who
      desires no better than to see me laugh and be happy. But to every man his
      own Cupid. If you cannot believe in love without sacrifices, you must have
      them, to be sure. And now, in sober sadness, what do you think your
      heroine would sacrifice for you? Her reputation? that, pardon me, is out
      of her power. Her virtue? I have no doubt she would. But before I can
      estimate the value of this sacrifice, I must know whether she makes it to
      you or to her pleasure. Would she give up in any instance her pleasure for
      your happiness? This is not an easy matter to ascertain with respect to a
      mistress: but your wife has put it beyond a doubt, that she prefers your
      happiness not only to her pleasure, but to her pride, and to every thing
      that the sex usually prefer to a husband. You have been wounded by a
      poisoned arrow; but you have a faithful wife who can extract the poison.
      Lady Leonora&rsquo;s affection is not a mere fit of goodness and generosity,
      such as I have seen in many women, but it is a steadiness of attachment in
      the hour of trial, which I have seen in few. For several months past you
      have, by your own account, put her temper and her love to the most severe
      tests, yet she has never failed for one moment, never reproached you by
      word or look.&mdash;But may be she has no feeling.&mdash;No feeling! you
      can have none, if you say so: no penetration, if you think so. Would not
      you think me a tyrant if I put a poor fellow on the picket, and told you,
      when he bore it without a groan, that it was because he could not feel?
      You do worse, you torture the soul of the woman who loves you; she
      endures, she is calm, she smiles upon you even in agony; and you tell me
      she cannot feel! she cannot feel like an Olivia! No; and so much the
      better for her husband, for she will then have only feeling enough for
      him, she will not extend her charity to all his sex. But Olivia has such
      candour and magnanimity, that I must admire her! I humbly thank her for
      offering to make me her confidant, for offering to tell me what I know
      already, and what she is certain that I know. These were good moves, but I
      understand the game as well as her ladyship does. As to her making a
      friend of me; if she means an enemy to Lady Leonora L&mdash;&mdash;, I
      would sooner see her&mdash;in heaven: but if she would do me the favour to
      think no more of your heart, which is too good for her, and to accept of
      my&mdash;my&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;my devoirs, I am at her command.
      She shall drive my curricle, &amp;c. &amp;c. She would suit me vastly well
      for a month or two, and by that time poor R&mdash;&mdash; would make his
      appearance, or somebody in his stead: at the worst, I should have a chance
      of some blessed metaphysical quirk, which would prove that inconstancy was
      a virtue, or that a new love is better than an old one. When it came to
      that, I should make my best bow, put on my most disconsolate face, and
      retire.
    </p>

    <h3>
      LETTER XLVI.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      OLIVIA TO MADAME DE P&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      We have been very gay here the last few days: the gallant and accomplished
      Prince &mdash;&mdash; has been here. H&mdash;&mdash;, the witty H&mdash;&mdash;,
      who is his favourite companion, introduced him; and he seems so much
      charmed with the old castle, its towers and battlements, and with its <i>cynosure</i>,
      that I know not when he will be able to prevail upon himself to depart.
      To-morrow, he says; but so he has said these ten days: he cannot resist
      the entreaties of his kind host and hostess to stay another day. The soft
      accent of the beautiful Leonora will certainly detain him <i>one day more</i>,
      and her gracious smile will bereave him of rest for months to come. He has
      evidently fallen desperately in love with her. Now we shall see virtue in
      danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have always been of opinion with St. Evremond and Ninon de l&rsquo;Enclos,
      that no female virtue can stand every species of test; fortunately it is
      not always exposed to trial. Reputation may be preserved by certain
      persons in certain situations, upon very easy terms. Leonora, for
      instance, is armed so strong in character, that no common mortal will
      venture to attack her. It would be presumption little short of high
      treason to imagine the fall of the Lady Leonora L&mdash;&mdash;, the
      daughter of the Duchess of &mdash;&mdash;, who, with a long line of
      immaculate baronesses in their own right, each in her armour of stiff
      stays, stands frowning defiance upon the adventurous knights. More
      alarming still to the modern seducer, appears a judge in his long wig, and
      a jury with their long faces, ready to bring in their verdict, and to
      award damages proportionate to the rank and fortune of the parties. Then
      the former reputation of the lady is talked of, and the irreparable injury
      sustained by the disconsolate husband from the loss of the solace and
      affection of this paragon of wives. And it is proved that she lived in the
      most perfect harmony with him, till the vile seducer appeared; who, in
      aggravation of damages, was a confidential friend of the husband&rsquo;s, &amp;c.
      &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brave, indeed, and desperately in love must be the man, who could dare all
      these to deserve the fair. But princes are, it is said, naturally brave,
      and ambitious of conquering difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have insinuated these reflections in a general way to L&mdash;&mdash;,
      who applies them so as to plague himself sufficiently. Heaven is my
      witness, that I mean no injury to Lady Leonora; yet I fear that there are
      moments, when my respect for her superiority, joined to the consciousness
      of my own weakness, overpowers me, and I almost envy her the right she
      retains to the esteem of the man I love. This is a blamable weakness&mdash;I
      know it&mdash;I reproach myself bitterly; but all I can do is to confess
      it candidly. L&mdash;&mdash; sees my conflicts, and knows how to value the
      sensibility of my fond heart. Adieu, my Gabrielle. When shall I be happy?
      since even love has its torments, and I am thus doomed to be ever a victim
      to the tenderness of my soul.

    <h3>
      LETTER XLVII.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      MRS. C&mdash;&mdash; TO MISS B&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I do not know whether I pity, love, or admire Leonora most. Just when her
      mind was deeply wounded by her husband&rsquo;s neglect, and when her jealousy
      was worked to the highest pitch by his passion for her dangerous rival,
      the Prince &mdash;&mdash; arrives here, and struck by Leonora&rsquo;s charms of
      mind and person, falls passionately in love with her. Probably his
      highness&rsquo;s friend H&mdash;&mdash; had given him a hint of the existing
      circumstances, and he thought a more propitious moment could scarcely be
      found for making an impression upon a female mind. He judged of Leonora by
      other women. And I, like a simpleton, judged of her by myself. With shame
      I confess to you, my dear Margaret, that notwithstanding all my past
      experience, I did expect that she would have done, as I am afraid I should
      have done in her situation. I think that I could not have resisted the
      temptation of coquetting a little&mdash;a very little&mdash;just to revive
      the passion of the man whom I really loved. This expedient succeeds so
      often with that wise sex, who never rightly know the value of a heart,
      except when they have just won it, or at the moment when they are on the
      point of losing it. In Leonora&rsquo;s place and in such an emergency, I should
      certainly have employed that frightful monster jealousy to waken sleeping
      love; since he, and only he, can do it expeditiously and effectually. This
      I have hinted to Leonora, talking always <i>in generals</i>; for, since my
      total overthrow, I have never dared to come to particulars: but by putting
      cases and <i>confessing myself</i>, I contrived to make my thoughts
      understood. I then boasted of the extreme facility of the means I would
      adopt to recover a heart. Leonora answered in the words of a celebrated
      great man:&mdash;&ldquo;C&rsquo;est facile de se servir de pareils moyens; c&rsquo;est
      difficile de s&rsquo;y résoudre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if no other means would succeed,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;would not you sacrifice
      your pride to your love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My pride, willingly; but not my sense of what is right,&rdquo; said she, with
      an indescribable mixture of tenderness and firmness in her manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can a little coquetry in a good cause be such a heinous offence?&rdquo;
       persisted I. I knew that I was wrong all the time; but I delighted in
      seeing how right she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      No&mdash;she would not allow her mind to be cheated by female sophistry;
      nor yet by the male casuistry of, &ldquo;the end sanctifies the means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had the misfortune to lose the affections of the man you love, and
      if you were quite certain of regaining them by following my recipe?&rdquo; said
      I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never shall I forget the look with which Leonora left me, and the accent
      with which she said, &ldquo;My dear Helen, if it were ever to be my misfortune
      to lose my husband&rsquo;s love, I would not, even if I were certain of success,
      attempt to regain it by any unworthy arts. How could I wish to regain his
      love at the hazard of losing his esteem, and the certainty of forfeiting
      my own!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said no more&mdash;I had nothing more to say: I saw that I had given
      pain, and I have never touched upon the subject since. But her practice is
      even beyond her theory. Never, by deed, or look, or word, or thought (for
      I see all her thoughts in her eloquent countenance), has she swerved from
      her principles. No prudery&mdash;no coquetry&mdash;no mock-humility&mdash;no
      triumph. Never for an instant did she, by a proud air, say to her husband,&mdash;See
      what others think of me! Never did a resentful look say to him&mdash;Inconstant!&mdash;revenge
      is in my power! Never even did a reproachful sigh express&mdash;I am
      injured, yet I do not retaliate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;is blind; he is infatuated; he is absolutely bereaved
      of judgment by a perfidious, ungrateful, and cruel wretch. Let me vent my
      indignation to you, dear Margaret, or it will explode, perhaps, when it
      may do Leonora mischief. Yours affectionately, Helen C&mdash;&mdash;.

      This Lady Leonora, in her simplicity, never dreamed of love till the
      prince&rsquo;s passion was too visible and audible to be misunderstood: and then
      she changed her tone, and checked her simplicity, and was so reserved, and
      so dignified, and so <i>proper</i>, it was quite edifying, especially to a
      poor sinner of a coquette like me; nothing <i>piquante</i>; nothing <i>agaçante</i>;
      nothing <i>demi-voílée</i>; no retiring to be pursued; not a single
      manoeuvre of coquetry did she practise. This convinces me that she cares
      not in the least for her husband; because, if she really loved him, and
      wished to reclaim his heart, what so natural or so simple as to excite his
      jealousy, and thus revive his love? After neglecting this golden
      opportunity, she can never convince me that she is really anxious about
      her husband&rsquo;s heart. This I hinted to L&mdash;&mdash;, and his own
      susceptibility had hinted it to him efficaciously, before I spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Leonora has been so correct hitherto, and so cold to the prince in
      her husband&rsquo;s presence, I have my suspicions that, if in his absence,
      proper means were taken, if her pride were roused by apt suggestions, if
      it were delicately pointed out to her that she is shamefully neglected,
      that she is a cipher in her own house, that her husband presumes too much
      upon her sweetness of temper, that his inconstancy is wondered at by all
      who have eyes, and that a little retaliation might become her ladyship, I
      would not answer for her forbearance, that is to say if all this were done
      by a dexterous man, a lover and a prince! I shall take care my opinions
      shall be known; for I cannot endure to have the esteem of the man I love
      monopolized. Exposed to temptation, as I have been, and with as ardent
      affections, Leonora, or I am much mistaken, would not have been more
      estimable. Adieu, my dearest Gabrielle. Nous verrons! nous verrons!

    <p>
      O you, whom no kindness can touch, whom no honour can bind, whom no faith
      can hold, enjoy the torments you have inflicted on me! enjoy the triumph
      of having betrayed a confiding friend! Friend no more&mdash;affect,
      presume no longer to call me friend! I am under no necessity to dissemble,
      and dissimulation is foreign to my habits, and abhorrent to my nature! I
      know you to be my enemy, and I say so&mdash;my most cruel enemy; one who
      could, without reluctance or temptation, rob me of all I hold most dear.
      Yes, without temptation; for you do not love my husband, Olivia. On this
      point I cannot be mistaken; I know too well what it is to love him. Had
      you been struck by his great or good and amiable qualities, charmed by his
      engaging manners, or seduced by the violence of his passion; and had I
      seen you honourably endeavour to repress that passion; had I seen in you
      the slightest disposition to sacrifice your pleasure or your vanity to
      friendship or to duty, I think I could have forgiven, I am sure I should
      have pitied you. But you felt no pity for me, no shame for yourself; you
      made no attempt to avoid, you invited the danger. Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; was
      not the deceiver, but the deceived. By every art and every charm in your
      power&mdash;and you have many&mdash;you won upon his senses and worked
      upon his imagination; you saw, and made it your pride to conquer the
      scruples of that affection he once felt for his wife, and that wife was
      your friend. By passing bounds, which he could not conceive that any woman
      could pass, except in the delirium of passion, you made him believe that
      your love for him exceeds all that I feel. How he will find himself
      deceived! If you had loved him as I do, you could not so easily have
      forfeited all claim to his esteem. Had you loved him so much, you would
      have loved honour more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible that Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; may taste some pleasure with you
      whilst his delusion lasts, whilst his imagination paints you, as mine once
      did, in false colours, possessed of generous virtues, and the victim of
      excessive sensibility: but when he sees you such as you are, he will
      recoil from you with aversion, he will reject you with contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing my opinion of you, Lady Olivia, you will not choose to remain in
      this house; nor can I desire for my guest one whom I can no longer, in
      private or in public, make my companion.

      Farewell for ever!&mdash;It must be so&mdash;Farewell for ever! Would to
      Heaven I had summoned courage sooner to pronounce these fatal, necessary,
      irrevocable words: then had I parted from you without remorse, without the
      obloquy to which I am now exposed. Oh, my dearest L&mdash;&mdash;! Mine,
      do I still dare to call you? Yes, mine for the last time, I must call you,
      mine I must fancy you, though for the impious thought the Furies
      themselves were to haunt me to madness. My dearest L&mdash;&mdash;, never
      more must we meet in this world! Think not that my weak voice alone
      forbids it: no, a stronger voice than mine is heard&mdash;an injured wife
      reclaims you. What a letter have I just received...!&mdash;from.....Leonora!
      She tells me that she no longer desires for her guest one whom she cannot,
      in public or private, make her companion&mdash;Oh, Leonora, it was
      sufficient to banish me from your heart! She tells me not only that I have
      for ever forfeited her confidence; her esteem, her affection; but that I
      shall soon be your aversion and contempt. Oh, cruel, cruel words! But I
      submit&mdash;I have deserved it all&mdash;I have robbed her of a heart
      above all price. Leonora, why did you not reproach me more bitterly? I
      desire, I implore to be crushed, to be annihilated by your vengeance! Most
      admirable, most virtuous, most estimable of women, best of wives, I have
      with sacrilegious love profaned a soul consecrated to you and conjugal
      virtue. I acknowledge my crime; trample upon me as you will, I am humbled
      in the dust. More than all your bitterest reproaches, do I feel the
      remorse of having, for a moment, interrupted such serenity of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, why did you persuade me, L&mdash;&mdash;, and why did I believe that
      Leonora was calm and free from all suspicion? How could I believe that any
      woman whom you had ever loved, could remain blind to your inconstancy, or
      feel secure indifference? Happy woman! in you to love is not a crime; you
      may glory in your passion, whilst I must hide mine from every human eye,
      drop in shameful secrecy the burning tear, stifle the struggling sigh,
      blush at the conflicts of virtue and sensibility, and carry shame and
      remorse with me to the grave. Happy Leonora! happy even when most injured,
      you have a right to complain to him you love;&mdash;he is yours&mdash;you
      are his wife&mdash;his esteem, his affection are yours. On Olivia he has
      bestowed but a transient thought, and eternal ignominy must be her
      portion. So let it be&mdash;so I wish it to be. Would to Heaven I may thus
      atone for the past, and secure your future felicity! Fly to her, my
      dearest L&mdash;&mdash;, I conjure you! throw yourself at her feet,
      entreat, implore, obtain her forgiveness. She cannot refuse it to your
      tears, to your caresses. To withstand them she must be more or less than
      woman. No, she cannot resist your voice when it speaks words of peace and
      love; she will press you with transport to her heart, and Olivia, poor
      Olivia, will be for ever forgotten; yet she will rejoice in your felicity;
      absolved perhaps in the eye of Heaven, though banished from your society,
      she will die content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full well am I aware of the consequences of quitting thus precipitately
      the house of Lady Leonora L&mdash;&mdash;; but nothing that concerns
      myself alone can, for a moment, make me hesitate to do that, which the
      sentiment of virtue dictates, and which is yet more strongly urged by
      regard for the happiness of one, who once allowed me to call her friend. I
      know my reputation is irrecoverably sacrificed; but it is to one for whom
      I would lay down my life. Can a woman who feels as I do deem any earthly
      good a sacrifice for him she loves? Dear L&mdash;&mdash;, adieu for ever!

      Dearest Mother,
    </p>
    <p>
      It is all over&mdash;my husband is gone&mdash;gone perhaps for ever&mdash;all
      is in vain&mdash;all is lost!
    </p>
    <p>
      Without saying more to you than I ought, I may tell you, that in
      consequence of an indignant letter which I wrote last night to Lady
      Olivia, she left my house this morning early, before any of the family
      were up. Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; heard of her departure before I did. He has,
      I will not say followed her, for of that I am not certain; but he has
      quitted home, and without giving me one kind look at parting, without even
      noticing a letter which I left last night upon his table. At what slight
      things we catch to save us from despair! How obstinate, how vain is hope!
      I fondly hoped, even to the last moment, that this letter, this foolish
      letter, would work a sudden change in my husband&rsquo;s heart, would operate
      miracles, would restore me to happiness. I fancied, absurdly fancied, that
      laying open my whole soul to him would have an effect upon his mind. Alas!
      has not my whole soul been always open to him? Could this letter tell him
      any thing but what he knows already, or what he will never know&mdash;how
      well I love him! I was weak to expect so much from it; yet as it expressed
      without complaint the anguish of disappointed affection, it deserved at
      least some acknowledgment. Could not he have said, &ldquo;My dear Leonora, I
      thank you for your letter?&rdquo;&mdash;or more colder still&mdash;&ldquo;Leonora, I
      have received your letter?&rdquo; Even that would have been some relief to me:
      but now all is despair. I saw him just when he was going away, but for a
      moment; till the last instant he was not to be seen; then, in spite of all
      his command of countenance, I discerned strong marks of agitation; but
      towards me an air of resentment, more than any disposition to kinder
      thoughts. I fancy that he scarcely knew what he said, nor, I am sure, did
      I. He talked, I remember, of having immediate business in town, and I
      endeavoured to believe him. Contrary to his usual composed manner, he was
      in such haste to be gone, that I was obliged to send his watch and purse
      after him, which he had left on his dressing-table. How melancholy his
      room looked to me! His clothes just as he had left them&mdash;a rose which
      Lady Olivia gave him yesterday was in water on his table. My letter was
      not there; so he has it, probably unread. He will read it some time or
      other, perhaps&mdash;and some time or other, perhaps, when I am dead and
      gone, he will believe I loved him. Could he have known what I felt at the
      moment when he turned from me, he would have pitied me; for his nature,
      his character, cannot be quite altered in a few months, though he has
      ceased to love Leonora. From the window of his own room I watched for the
      last glimpse of him&mdash;heard him call to the postilions, and bid them
      &ldquo;drive fast&mdash;faster.&rdquo; This was the last sound I heard of his voice.
      When shall I hear that voice again? I think that I shall certainly hear
      from him the day after to-morrow&mdash;and I wish to-day and to-morrow
      were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am afraid that you will think me very weak; but, my dear mother, I have
      no motive for fortitude now; and perhaps it might have been better for me,
      if I had not exerted so much. I begin to fear that all my fortitude is
      mistaken for indifference. Something Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; said the other
      day, about sensibility and sacrifices, gave me this idea. Sensibility!&mdash;It
      has been my hard task for some months past to repress mine, that it might
      not give pain or disgust. I have done all that my reason and my dearest
      mother counselled; surely I cannot have done wrong. How apt we are to
      mistake the opinion or the taste of the man we love for the rule of right!
      Sacrifices! What sacrifices can I make?&mdash;All that I have, is it not
      his?&mdash;My whole heart, is it not his? Myself, all that I am, all that
      I <i>can</i> be? Have I not lived with him of late, without recalling to
      his mind the idea that I suffer by his neglect? Have I not left his heart
      at liberty, and can I make a greater sacrifice? I really do not understand
      what he means by sacrifices. A woman who loves her husband is part of him;
      whatever she does for him is for herself. I wish he would explain to me
      what he can mean by sacrifices&mdash;but when will he ever again explain
      his thoughts and feelings to me?
    </p>
    <p>
      My dearest mother, it has been a relief to my mind to write all this to
      you; if there is no sense in it, you will forgive and encourage me by your
      affection and strength of mind, which, in all situations, have such power
      to soothe and support your daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince &mdash;&mdash;, who spent a fortnight here, paid me particular
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince talked of soon paying us another visit. If he should, I will
      not receive him in Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s absence. This may seem like
      vanity or prudery; but no matter what it appears, if it be right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well might you, my best friend, bid me beware of forming an intimacy with
      an unprincipled woman. I have suffered severely for neglecting your
      counsels; how much I have still to endure is yet to be tried: but I can
      never be entirely miserable whilst I possess, and whilst I hope that I
      deserve, the affection of such a mother.

    <h3>
      THE DUCHESS OF &mdash;&mdash; TO HER DAUGHTER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      If my approbation and affection can sustain you in this trying situation,
      your fortitude will not forsake you, my beloved daughter. Great minds rise
      in adversity; they are always equal to the trial, and superior to
      injustice: betrayed and deserted, they feel their own force, and they rely
      upon themselves. Be yourself, my Leonora! Persevere as you have begun,
      and, trust me, you will be happy. I abide by my first opinion, I repeat my
      prophecy&mdash;your husband&rsquo;s esteem, affection, love, will be permanently
      yours. Change of circumstances, however alarming, cannot shake the fixed
      judgment of my understanding. Character, as you justly observe, cannot
      utterly change in a few months. Your husband is deceived, he is now as one
      in the delirium of a fever: he will recover his senses, and see Lady
      Olivia and you such as you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      You do not explain, and I take it for granted you have good reasons for
      not explaining to me more fully, the immediate cause of your letter to
      Lady Olivia. I am sorry that any cause should have thrown her upon the
      protection of Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;; for a man of honour and generosity
      feels himself bound to treat with tenderness a woman who appears to
      sacrifice every thing for his sake. Consider this in another point of
      view, and it will afford you subject of consolation; for it is always a
      consolation to good minds, to think those whom they love less to blame
      than they appear to be. You will be more calm and patient when you reflect
      that your husband&rsquo;s absence may be prolonged by a mistaken sense of
      honour. From the nature of his connexion with Lady Olivia it cannot last
      long. Had she saved appearances, and engaged him in a sentimental affair,
      it might have been far more dangerous to your happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I entirely approve of your conduct with respect to the prince: it is
      worthy of my child, and just what I should have expected from her. The
      artifices of coquettes, and all the <i>art</i> of love is beneath her; she
      has far other powers and resources, and need not strive to maintain her
      dignity by vengeance. I admire your magnanimity, and I still more admire
      your good sense; for high spirit is more common in our sex than good
      sense. Few know how, and when, they should sacrifice small considerations
      to great ones. You say that you will not receive the prince in your
      husband&rsquo;s absence, though this may be attributed to prudery or vanity,
      &amp;c. &amp;c. You are quite right. How many silly women sacrifice the
      happiness of their lives to the idea of what women or men, as silly as
      themselves, will say or think of their motives. How many absurd heroines
      of romance, and of those who imitate them in real life, do we see, who can
      never act with common sense or presence of mind: if a man&rsquo;s carriage
      breaks down, or his horse is tired at the end of their avenues, or for
      some such ridiculous reason, they must do the very reverse of all they
      know to be prudent. Perpetually exposed, by a fatal concurrence of
      circumstances, to excite the jealousy of their lovers and husbands, they
      create the necessity to which they fall a victim. I rejoice that I cannot
      feel any apprehension of my daughter&rsquo;s conducting herself like one of
      these novel-bred ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sorry, my dear, that Lady M&mdash;&mdash; and your friends have left
      you: yet even in this there may be good. Your affairs will be made less
      public, and you will be less the subject of impertinent curiosity. I
      advise you, however, to mix as much as usual with your neighbours in the
      country: your presence, and the dignity of your manners, will impose
      silence upon idle tongues. No wife of real spirit solicits the world for
      compassion: she who does not court popularity ensures respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adieu, my dearest child: the time will come when your husband will feel
      the full merit of your fortitude; when he will know how to distinguish
      between true and false sensibility; between the love of an Olivia and of a
      Leonora. &mdash;&mdash;.

      I do not think I could have borne with temper, from any other man

      it was written with the best intentions for my happiness; but I must now

      It is no longer a question, what she will sacrifice for me; she has shown

      Richmond, &mdash;&mdash;.

    <p>
      Happy!&mdash;No, my dear Gabrielle, nor shall I ever be happy, whilst I
      have not exclusive possession of the heart of the man I love. I have
      sacrificed every thing to him; I have a right to expect that he should
      sacrifice at least a wife for me&mdash;a wife whom he only esteems. But L&mdash;&mdash;
      has not sufficient strength of mind to liberate himself from the cobwebs
      which restrain those who talk of conscience, and who, in fact, are only
      superstitious. I see with indignation, that his soul is continually
      struggling between passion for me and a something, I know not what to call
      it, that he feels for this wife. His thoughts are turning towards home. I
      believe that to an Englishman&rsquo;s ears, there is some magic in the words <i>home</i>
      and <i>wife</i>. I used to think foreigners ridiculous for associating the
      ideas of Milord Anglois with roast beef and pudding; but I begin to see
      that they are quite right, and that an Englishman has a certain set of
      inveterate <i>homely</i> prejudices, which are necessary to his
      well-being, and almost to his existence. You may entice him into the land
      of sentiment, and for a time keep him there; but refine and polish and
      enlighten him, as you will, he recurs to his own plain sense, as he terms
      it, on the first convenient opportunity. In short, it is lost labour to
      civilize him, for sooner or later he will <i>hottentot</i> again. Pray
      introduce that term, Gabrielle&mdash;<i>you</i> can translate it. For my
      part, I can introduce nothing here; my manière d&rsquo;être is really
      insupportable; my talents are lost; I, who am accustomed to shine in
      society, see nobody; I might, as Josephine every day observes, as well be
      buried alive. Retirement and love are charming; but then it must be
      perfect love&mdash;not the equivocating sort that L&mdash;&mdash; feels
      for me, which keeps the word of promise only to the ear. I bear every sort
      of désagrément for him; I make myself a figure for the finger of scorn to
      point at, and he insults me with esteem for a wife. Can you conceive this,
      my amiable Gabrielle?&mdash;No, there are ridiculous points in the
      characters of my countrymen which you will never be able to comprehend.
      And what is still more incomprehensible, it is my fate to love this man;
      yes, passionately to love him!&mdash;But he must give me proof of
      reciprocal passion. I have too much spirit to sacrifice every thing for
      him, who will sacrifice nothing for me. Besides, I have another motive. To
      you, my faithful Gabrielle, I open my whole heart.&mdash;Pride inspires me
      as well as love. I am resolved that Leonora, the haughty Leonora, shall
      live to repent of having insulted and exasperated Olivia. In some
      situations contempt can be answered only by vengeance; and when the malice
      of a contracted and illiberal mind provokes it, revenge is virtue. Leonora
      has called me her enemy, and consequently has made me such. &lsquo;Tis she has
      declared the war! &lsquo;tis for me to decide the victory!
    </p>
    <p>
      L&mdash;&mdash;, I know, has the offer of an embassy to Petersburg.&mdash;He
      shall accept it.&mdash;I will accompany him thither. Lady Leonora may, in
      his absence, console herself with her august counsellor and mother:&mdash;that
      proudest of earthly paragons is yet to be taught the extent of Olivia&rsquo;s
      power. Adieu, my charming Gabrielle! I will carry your tenderest
      remembrances to our brilliant Russian princess. She has often invited me,
      you know, to pay her a visit, and this will be the ostensible object of my
      journey. A horrible journey, to be sure!!!&mdash;But what will not love
      undertake and accomplish, especially when goaded by pride, and inspirited
      by great revenge?

      LETTER LIX.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      MR. L&mdash;&mdash; TO GENERAL B&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      My Dear General,
    </p>
    <p>
      I am come to a resolution to accept of that embassy to Russia which I
      lately refused. My mind has been in such constant anxiety for some time
      past, that my health has suffered, and change of air and place are
      necessary to me. You will say, that the climate of Russia is a strange
      choice for an invalid: I could indeed have wished for a milder; but in
      this world we must be content with the least of two evils. I wish to have
      some ostensible reason for going abroad, and this embassy is the only one
      that presents itself in an unquestionable shape. Any thing is better than
      staying where I am, and as I am. My motives are not so entirely personal
      and selfish as I have stated them. A man who has a grain of feeling cannot
      endure to see the woman whom he loves, whose only failing is her love,
      living in a state of dereliction, exposed to the silent scorn of her
      equals and inferiors, if not to open insult. All her fine talents, every
      advantage of nature and education sacrificed, and her sensibility to shame
      a perpetual source of misery. A man must be a brute if he do not feel for
      a woman, whose affection for him has reduced her to this situation. My
      delicacy as to female manners, and the high value I set upon public
      opinion in all that concerns the sex, make me peculiarly susceptible and
      wretched in my present circumstances. To raise the drooping spirits, and
      support the self-approbation of a woman, who is conscious that she has
      forfeited her claim to respect&mdash;to make love supply the place of all
      she has sacrificed to love, is a difficult and exquisitely painful task.
      My feelings render hers more acute, and the very precautions which I take,
      however delicate, alarm and wound her pride, by reminding her of all she
      wishes to forget. In this country, no woman, who is not lost to shame, can
      bear to live without reputation.&mdash;I pass over a great many
      intermediate ideas, my dear general; your sense and feeling will supply
      them. You see the expediency, the necessity of my accepting this embassy.
      Olivia urges, how can I refuse it? She wishes to accompany me. She made
      this offer with such decision of spirit, with such passionate tenderness,
      as touched me to the very soul. A woman who really loves, absolutely
      devotes herself, and becomes insensible to every difficulty and danger; to
      her all parts of the world are alike; all she fears is to be separated
      from the object of her affections.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the very excess of certain passions proves them to be genuine. Even
      whilst we blame the rashness of those who act from the enthusiasm of their
      natures, whilst we foresee all the perils to which they seem blind, we
      tremble at their danger, we grow more and more interested for them every
      moment, we admire their courage, we long to snatch them from their fate,
      we are irresistibly hurried along with them down the precipice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why do I say all this to you, my dear general? To no man upon earth
      could it be more ineffectually addressed. Let me see you, however, before
      we leave England. It would be painful to me to quit this country without
      taking leave of you, notwithstanding all that you have lately done to
      thwart my inclinations, and notwithstanding all I may expect you to say
      when we meet. Probably I shall be detained here some weeks, as I must wait
      for instructions from our court. I write this day to Lady Leonora, to
      inform her that I am appointed ambassador to Russia. She shall have all
      the honours of war; she shall be treated with all the respect to which she
      is so well entitled. I suppose she will wish to reside with her mother
      during my absence. She cannot do better: she will then be in the most
      eligible situation, and I shall be relieved from all anxiety upon her
      account. She will be perfectly happy with her mother. I have often thought
      that she was much happier before she married me, than she has been since
      our union.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have some curiosity to know whether she will see the Prince when I am
      gone. Do not mistake me; I am not jealous: I have too little love, and too
      much esteem for Leonora, to feel the slightest jealousy. I have no doubt,
      that if I were to stay in Russia for ten years, and if all the princes and
      potentates in Europe were to be at her feet, my wife would conduct herself
      with the most edifying propriety: but I am a little curious to know how
      far vanity or pride can console a virtuous woman for the absence of love.
    </p>

      MADAME DE P&mdash;&mdash; TO OLIVIA.

    <p>
      Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are really decided then to go to Russia, my amiable friend, and you
      will absolutely undertake this horrible voyage! And you are not
      intimidated by the idea of the immense distance between Petersburg and
      Paris! Alas! I had hoped soon to see you again. The journey from my
      convent to Paris was the longest and most formidable that I ever
      undertook, and at this moment it appears to me terrible; you may conceive
      therefore my admiration of your courage and strength of mind, my dear
      Olivia, who are going to brave the ocean, turning your back on Paris, and
      every moment receding from our polished centre of attraction, to perish
      perhaps among mountains of ice. Mon Dieu! it makes me shudder to think of
      it. But if it please Heaven that you should once arrive at Petersburg, you
      will crown your tresses with diamonds, you will envelope yourself with
      those superb furs of the north, and smiling at all the dangers you have
      passed, you will be yourself a thousand times more dangerous than they.
      You, who have lived so long at Paris, who speak our language in all its
      shades of elegance; you, who have divined all our secrets of pleasing, who
      have caught our very air,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Et la grace, encore plus belle que la beauté;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      you, who are absolutely a French woman, and a Parisian, what a sensation
      you will produce at Petersburg!&mdash;Quels succès vous attendent!&mdash;Quels
      hommages!
    </p>
    <p>
      You will have the goodness to offer my tenderest sentiments, and the
      assurances of my perfect respect, to our dear Princess; you will also find
      the proper moment to remind her of the promise she made, to send me
      specimens of the fine ermines and sables of her country. For my part, I
      used to be, I confess, in a great error with respect to furs: I always
      acknowledged them to be rich, but avoided them as heavy; I considered them
      as fitter for the stiff magnificence of an Empress of all the Russias than
      for the light elegance of a Parisian beauty; but our charming Princess
      convinced me that this is a heresy in taste. When I beheld the grace with
      which she wore her ermine, and the art with which she knew how to vary its
      serpent folds as she moved, or as she spoke, the variety it gave to her
      costume and attitudes; the development it afforded to a fine hand and arm,
      the resource in the pauses of conversation, and that soft and attractive
      air which it seemed to impart even to the play of her wit, I could no
      longer refuse my homage to ermine. Such is the despotism of beauty over
      all the objects of taste and fashion; and so it is, that a woman of sense,
      address, and sentiment, let her be born or thrown by fate where she may,
      will always know how to avail herself of every possible advantage of
      nature and art. Nothing will be too trifling or too vast for her genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must make you understand me, my dear Olivia; your Gabrielle is not so
      frivolous as simpletons imagine. Frivolity is an excellent, because an
      unsuspected mask, under which serious and important designs may be safely
      concealed. I would explain myself further, but must now go to the opera to
      see the new ballet. Let me know, my interesting, my sublime Olivia, when
      you are positively determined on your voyage to Petersburg; and then you
      shall become acquainted with your friend as a politician. Her friendship
      for you will not be confined to a mere intercourse of sentiment, but will,
      if you have courage to second her views, give you a secret yet decisive
      weight and consequence, of which you have hitherto never dreamed.&mdash;Adieu.&mdash;These
      gentlemen are so impatient, I must go. Burn the last page of this letter,
      and the whole of my next as soon as you have read it, I conjure you, my
      dear.

      DEAR L&mdash;&mdash;,

    <p>
      I have time but to write one line to satisfy that philosophical curiosity,
      which, according to your injunctions, I will not denominate jealousy&mdash;except
      when I talk to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have a philosophical curiosity to know whether your wife will see the
      Prince in your absence. I saw his favourite yesterday, who complained to
      me that his highness had been absolutely refused admittance at your
      castle, notwithstanding he had made many ingenious, and some bold
      attempts, to see Lady Leonora L&mdash;&mdash; in the absence of her
      faithless husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to your scheme of going to Russia, you will be obliged, luckily, to
      wait for some time for instructions, and in the interval, it is to be
      hoped you will recover your senses. I shall see you as soon as possible.

    <h3>
      MADAME DE P&mdash;&mdash; TO LADY OLIVIA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      As our vanity always endeavours to establish a balance between our own
      perfections and those of our friends, I must flatter myself, my dear
      Olivia, that in compensation for that courage and ardent imagination in
      which you are so much my superior, I possess some little advantages over
      you in my scientific, hereditary knowledge of court intrigue, and of the
      arts of representation; all which will be necessary to you in your
      character of ambassadress: you will in fact deserve this title, for of
      course you will govern the English ambassador, whom you honour with your
      love. And of course you will appear with splendour, and you will be
      particularly careful to have your <i>traineau</i> well appointed. Pray
      remember that one of your horses must gallop, whilst the other trots, or
      you are nobody. It will also be absolutely necessary to have a numerous
      retinue of servants, because this suits the Russian idea of magnificence.
      You must have, as the Russian nobles always had in Paris, four servants
      constantly to attend your equipage; one to carry the flambeau, another to
      open the door, and a couple to carry you into and out of your carriage. I
      beseech you to bear in mind perpetually, that you are to be as helpless as
      possible. A Frenchman of my acquaintance, who spent nine years in Russia,
      told me, that in his first setting out at Petersburg, he was put on his
      guard in this particular by a speech of his Russian valet-de-chambre:&mdash;&ldquo;Sir,
      the Englishman you visited to-day cannot be worthy of your acquaintance;
      he cannot be a gentleman. Son valet me dit qu&rsquo;il se déshabille seul!!!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I suppose you take Josephine with you; she will be an inestimable
      treasure; and I shall make it my business to send you the first advices of
      Paris fashions, which her talents will not fail to comprehend and execute.
      My charming Olivia! you will be the model of taste and elegance! Do not
      suspect that dress is carrying me away from politics. I assure you I know
      what I am about, and am going straight to my object. The art of attending
      to trifles is the art of governing the world, as all historians know, who
      have gone to the bottom of affairs. Was not the face of Europe changed by
      a cup of tea thrown on Mrs. Masham&rsquo;s gown, as Voltaire, with penetrating
      genius, remarks? Women, without a doubt, understand the importance of
      trifles better than men do, and consequently always move in secret the
      slight springs of that vast machine, the civilized world. Is not your
      ambition roused, my Olivia? You must, however, lay aside a little of your
      romance, and not approach the political machine whilst you are intoxicated
      with love, else you will blunder infallibly, and do infinite and
      irreparable mischief to yourself and your friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Permit me to tell you, that you have been a little spoiled by sentimental
      novels, which are good only to talk of when one must show sensibility, but
      destructive as rules of action. By the false lights which these writers,
      who know nothing of the world, have thrown upon objects, you have been
      deluded; you have been led to mistake the means for the end. Love has been
      with you the sole end of love; whereas it ought to be the beginning of
      power. No matter for the past: the future is yours: at our age this future
      must be dexterously managed. A woman of spirit, and, what is better, of
      sense, must always take care that in her heart, the age of love is not
      prolonged beyond the age of being beloved. In these times a woman has no
      choice at a certain period but politics, or bel esprit; for devotion,
      which used to be a resource, is no longer in fashion. We must all take a
      part, my dear; I assure you I have taken mine decidedly, and I predict
      that you will take yours with brilliant success. How often must one cry in
      the ears of lovers&mdash;Love must die! must die! must die! But you, my
      dear Olivia, will not be deaf to the warning voice of common sense. Your
      own experience has on former occasions convinced you, that passion cannot
      be eternal; and at present, if I mistake not, there is in your love a
      certain mixture of other feelings, a certain alloy, which will make it
      happily ductile and manageable. When your triumph over the wife is
      complete, passion for the husband will insensibly decay; and this will be
      fortunate for you, because assuredly your ambassador would not choose to
      remain all the rest of his days in love and in exile at Petersburg. All
      these English are afflicted with the maladie du pays; and, as you observe
      so well, the words home and wife have ridiculous but unconquerable power
      over their minds. What will become of you, my friend, when this Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;
      chooses to return to England to his castle, &amp;c.? You could not
      accompany him. You must provide in time against this catastrophe, or you
      will be a deserted, disgraced, undone woman, my dear friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one should begin to act a romance who has not well considered the
      dénouement. It is a charming thing to mount with a friend in a balloon,
      amid crowds of spectators, who admire the fine spectacle, and applaud the
      courage of the aërostats: the losing sight of this earth, and the being in
      or above the clouds, must also be delightful: but the moment will come
      when the travellers descend, and then begins the danger; then they differ
      about throwing out the ballast, the balloon is rent in the quarrel, it
      sinks with frightful rapidity, and they run the hazard, like the poor
      Marquis D&rsquo;Arlande, of being spitted upon the spire of the Invalides, or of
      being entangled among woods and briers&mdash;at last, alighting upon the
      earth, our adventurers, fatigued and bruised and disappointed, come out of
      their shattered triumphal car, exposed to the derision of the changeable
      multitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every thing in this world is judged of by success. Your voyage to
      Petersburg, my dear Olivia, must not be a mere adventure of romance; as a
      party of pleasure it would be ridiculous; we must make something more of
      it. Enclosed is a letter to a Russian nobleman, an old lover of mine, who,
      I understand, is in favour. He will certainly be at your command. He is a
      man possessed by the desire of having reputation among foreigners, vain of
      the preference of our sex, generous even to prodigality. By his means you
      will be immediately placed on an easy footing with all the leading persons
      of the Russian court. You will go on from one step to another, till you
      are at the height which I have in view. Now for my grand object.&mdash;No,
      not now&mdash;for I have forty little notes about nothings to write this
      morning. Great things hang upon these nothings, so they should not be
      neglected. I must leave you, my amiable Olivia, and defer my grand object
      till to-morrow.

    <h3>
      DEAR MOTHER,
    </h3>
    <p>
      This moment I have received a letter from Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;. He has
      accepted of an embassy to Petersburg. I cannot guess by the few lines he
      has written, whether or not he wishes that I should accompany him. Most
      ardently I wish it; but if my offer should be refused, or if it should be
      accepted only because it could not be well refused; if I should be a
      burthen, a restraint upon him, I should wish myself dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he accepts of this embassy on purpose that he may leave me and
      take another person with him: or perhaps, dearest mother (I hardly dare to
      hope it)&mdash;perhaps he wishes to break off that connexion, and goes to
      Russia to leave temptation behind him. I know that this embassy was
      offered to him some weeks ago, and he had then no thoughts of accepting
      it.&mdash;Oh that I could see into his heart&mdash;that heart which used
      to be always open to me! If I could discover what his wishes are, I should
      know what mine ought to be. I have thoughts of going to town immediately
      to see him; at least I may take leave of him. Do you approve of it? Write
      the moment you receive this; but I need not say that, for I am sure you
      will do so. Dearest mother, you have prophesied that his heart will return
      to me, and on this hope I live.

      Yes, my dear, I advise you by all means to go to town, and to see your
      husband. Your desire to accompany him to Russia he will know before you
      see him, for I have just written and despatched an express to him with
      your last letter, and with all those which I have received from you within
      these last six months. Leave Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; time to read them before
      he sees you; and do not hurry or fatigue yourself unnecessarily. You know
      that an embassy cannot be arranged in two days; therefore travel by easy
      journeys: you cannot do otherwise without hazard. Your courage in offering
      to undertake this long voyage with your husband is worthy of you, my
      beloved daughter. God bless and preserve you! If you go to Petersburg, let
      me know in time, that I may see you before you leave England. I will be at
      any moment at any place you appoint.

    </h3>
    <p>
      Perhaps this letter may find you at the feet of your mistress. Spare me,
      sir, a few moments from your pleasures. You may perhaps expect reproaches
      from the mother of your wife; but let me assure you, that you have none to
      apprehend. For my daughter&rsquo;s sake, if not for yours, I would forbear.
      Never was departing love recalled by the voice of reproach; you shall not
      hear it from me, you have not heard it from Leonora. But mistake not the
      cause of her forbearance; let it not be attributed to pusillanimity of
      temper, or insensibility of heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enclosed I send you all the letters which my daughter has written to me
      from the first day of her acquaintance with Lady Olivia to this hour. From
      these you will be enabled to judge of what she has felt for some months
      past, and of the actual state of her heart; you will see all the
      tenderness and all the strength of her soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has ever been my fixed opinion, that a wife who loves her husband, and
      who has possessed his affections, may reclaim them from the lure of the
      most artful of her sex, by persevering kindness, temper, and good sense,
      unless indeed her husband be a fool or a libertine. I have prophesied that
      my daughter will regain your heart; and upon this prophecy, to use her own
      expression, she lives. And even now, when its accomplishment is far
      removed, I am so steady in my opinion of her and of you; so convinced of
      the uniform result of certain conduct upon the human mind, that undismayed
      I repeat my prophecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were you to remain in this kingdom, I should leave things to their natural
      course; I should not interfere so far even as to send you Leonora&rsquo;s
      letters: but as you may be separated for years, I think it necessary now
      to put into your hands incontrovertible proofs of what she is, and what
      she has been. Do not imagine that I am so weak as to expect that the
      perusal of these letters will work a sudden change: but it is fit that,
      before you leave England, you should know that Leonora is not a cold,
      sullen, or offended wife; but one who loves you most tenderly, most
      generously; who, concealing the agony of her heart, waits with resignation
      for the time when she will be your refuge, and the permanent blessing of
      your life. &mdash;&mdash;.

      Paris.

    <p>
      And now, my charming Olivia, raise your fine eyes as high as ambition can
      look, and you will perhaps discover my grand object. You do not see it
      yet. Look again.&mdash;Do you not see the Emperor of Russia? What would
      you think of him for a lover? If it were only for novelty&rsquo;s sake, it would
      really be pleasant to have a Czar at one&rsquo;s feet. Reign in his heart, and
      you in fact seat yourself invisibly on the throne of all the Russias:
      thence what a commanding prospect you have of the affairs of Europe! and
      how we should govern the world at our ease! The project is bold, but not
      impracticable. The ancients represent Cupid riding the Numidian lion; and
      why should he not tame the Russian bear? It would make a pretty design for
      a vignette. I can engrave as well as La Pompadour could at least, and
      anticipating your victory, my charming Olivia, I will engrave Cupid
      leading the bear in a chain of flowers. This shall be my seal. Mon cachet
      de faveur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courage, my fair politician! You have a difficult task; but the glory is
      in proportion to the labour; and those who value power properly, are paid
      by its acquisition, for all possible fatigue and hardships. With your
      knowledge of our modes, you will be at Petersburg the arbitress of
      delights. You have a charming taste and invention for fêtes and
      spectacles. Teach these people to vary their pleasures. Their monarch must
      adore you, if you banish from his presence that most dreadful enemy of
      kings, and most obstinate resident of courts, <i>ennui</i>. Trust, my
      Olivia, neither to your wit, nor your beauty, nor your accomplishments,
      but employ your &ldquo;various arts of trifling prettily,&rdquo; and, take my word for
      it, you will succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I may not have an opportunity of sending you another private letter,
      and as lemon-juice, goulard, and all those sympathetic inks, are subject
      to unlucky accidents, I must send you all my secret instructions by the
      present safe conveyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must absolutely sacrifice, my dear child, all your romantic notions,
      and all your taste for love, to the grand object. The Czar must not have
      the slightest cause for jealousy. These Czars make nothing, you know, of
      cutting off their mistresses&rsquo; pretty heads upon the bare suspicion of an
      intrigue. But you must do what is still more difficult than to be
      constant, you must yield your will, and, what is more, you must never let
      this Czar guess that his will is not always your pleasure. Your humour,
      your tastes, your wishes, must be incessantly and with alacrity sacrificed
      to his. You must submit to the constraint of eternal court ceremony, and
      court dissimulation. You must bear to be surrounded with masks, instead of
      the human face divine; and instead of fellow-creatures, you must content
      yourself with puppets. You will have the amusement of pulling the wires:
      but remember that you must wear a mask perpetually as well as others, and
      never attempt to speak, and never expect to hear the language of truth or
      of the heart. You must not be the dupe of attachment in those who call
      themselves friends, or zealous and affectionate servants, &amp;c. &amp;c.
      You must have sufficient strength of character to bear continually in mind
      that all these professions are mere words, that all these people are alike
      false, and actuated but by one motive, self-interest. To secure yourself
      from secret and open enemies, you must farther have sufficient courage to
      live without a friend or a confidante, for such persons at court are only
      spies, traitors in the worst forms. All this is melancholy and provoking,
      to be sure; but all this you must see without feeling, or at least without
      showing a spark of indignation. A sentimental misanthropist, male or
      female, is quite out of place at court. You must see all that is odious
      and despicable in human nature in a comic point of view; and you must
      consider your fellow-creatures as objects to be laughed at, not to be
      hated. Laughter, besides being good for the health, and consequently for
      the complexion, always implies superiority. Without this gratification to
      our vanity, there would be no possibility of enduring that eternal penance
      of hypocrisy, and that solitary state of suspicion, to which the ambitious
      condemn themselves. I fear, my romantic Olivia, that you, who are a person
      used to yield to first impressions, and not quite accustomed to subdue
      your passions to your interest, will think that politics require too much
      from you, almost as much as constancy or religion. But consider the
      difference! for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, my dear, consider the greatness of our
      object! Would to God that I had the eloquence of Bossuet! and I would make

    </h3>
    <h3>
      MY DEAR FRIEND,
    </h3>
    <p>
      You need not hurry yourself to come to town on my account, for by this
      change of ministry my embassy will be delayed some weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days ago this delay would have been a terrible disappointment to me;
      yet now I feel it a respite. A respite! you will exclaim. Yes, my dear
      friend&mdash;so it is. Such is the heart of man!&mdash;so changeable, so
      contradictory, so much at variance with itself from day to day, from hour
      to hour. I believe, from what I now feel, that every man under the
      dominion of passion is reduced to a most absurd and miserable condition.&mdash;I
      have just been reading some letters from Leonora, which have wrung my
      heart; letters addressed to her mother, laying open every feeling of her
      mind for some months. My dear friend, what injustice have I done to this
      admirable woman! With what tenderness, with what delicacy has she loved
      me! while I, mistaking modesty for coldness, fortitude for indifference,
      have neglected, injured, and abandoned her! With what sweetness of temper,
      with what persevering goodness has she borne with me, while, intoxicated
      with passion, I saw every thing in a false point of view! How often have I
      satisfied myself with the persuasion, that she scarcely observed my
      attachment to Olivia, or beheld it unconcerned, secure by the absence of
      love from the pangs of jealousy! How often have I accused her of
      insensibility, whilst her heart was in tortures! Olivia was deceived also,
      and confirmed me in this cruel error. And all that time Leonora was
      defending her rival, and pleading her cause! With what generosity, with
      what magnanimity she speaks of Olivia in those letters! Her confidence was
      unbounded, her soul above suspicion; to the very last she doubted and
      blamed herself&mdash;dear, amiable woman! blamed herself for our faults,
      for feeling that jealousy, which no wife who loved as she did could
      possibly subdue. She never betrayed it by a single word or look of
      reproach. Even though she fainted at that cursed fête champêtre, yet the
      moment she came to her senses, she managed so, that none of the spectators
      could suspect she thought Olivia was her rival. My dear general, you will
      forgive me&mdash;as long as I praise Leonora you will understand me. At
      last you will acknowledge that I do justice to the merits of my wife.
      Justice! no&mdash;I am unworthy of her. I have no heart like hers to offer
      in return for such love. She wishes to go with me to Petersburg; she has
      forborne to make this offer directly to me; but I know it from her last
      letter to her mother, which now lies before me. How can I refuse?&mdash;and
      how can I accept? My soul is torn with violence different ways. How can I
      leave Leonora! and how can I tear myself from Olivia!&mdash;even if her
      charms had no power over my heart, how could I with honour desert the
      woman who has sacrificed every thing for me! I will not shield myself from
      you, my friend, behind the word honour. See me as you have always seen me,
      without disguise, and now without defence. I respect, I love Leonora&mdash;but,
      alas! I am in love with Olivia!

      MR. L&mdash;&mdash; TO OLIVIA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Triumphant as you are over my heart, dear enchanting Olivia! you cannot
      make me false. I cannot, even to appease your anger, deny this morning
      what I said last night. It is inconsistent with all your professions, with
      your character, with your generous disposition, to desire me to &ldquo;<i>abjure
      Leonora for ever!</i>&rdquo; it would be to render myself for ever unworthy of
      Olivia. I am convinced that had you read the letters of which I spoke, you
      would have been touched, you would have been struck by them as I was:
      instead of being hurt and displeased by the impression that they made upon
      me, you would have sympathized in my feelings, you would have been
      indignant if I had not admired, you would have detested and despised me if
      I could have been insensible to &ldquo;<i>so much goodness and generosity</i>.&rdquo;
       I repeat my words: I will not &ldquo;<i>retract</i>,&rdquo; I cannot &ldquo;<i>repent of
      them</i>.&rdquo; My dear Olivia! when you reflect upon what is past, I am
      persuaded you will acknowledge that your sensibility made you unjust.
      Indeed, my love, you did not show your usual candour; I had just read all
      that Leonora had written of you, all that she had urged against her mother
      in your defence; even when she had most cause to be irritated against us,
      I could not avoid being shocked by the different manner in which you spoke
      of her. Perhaps I told you so too abruptly: if I had loved you less, I
      should have been more cautious and more calm&mdash;if I had esteemed you
      less, calmer still. I could then, possibly, have borne to hear you speak
      in a manner unbecoming yourself. Forgive me the pain I gave you&mdash;the
      pain I now give you, my dearest Olivia! My sincerity is the best security
      you can have for my future love. Banish therefore this unjust, this
      causeless jealousy: moderate this excessive sensibility for both our
      sakes, and depend upon the power you have over my heart. You cannot
      conceive how much I have felt from this misunderstanding&mdash;the first
      we have ever had. Let it be the last. I have spent a sleepless night. I am
      detained in town by provoking, tiresome, but necessary business. Meet me
      in the evening with smiles, my Olivia: let me behold in those fascinating
      eyes their wonted expression, and hear from your voice its usual, its
      natural tone of tenderness and love.
    </p>

      me lower still&mdash;insult, debase, humble me to the dust. Exalt my
      rival, unroll to my aching eyes the emblazoned catalogue of her merits,
      her claims to your esteem, your affection; number them over, dwell upon
      those that I have forfeited, those which can never be regained; tell me

      sensibility! Restrain my sensibility! Unhappy Olivia! he is tired of your
      love. Let him then at once tell me the dreadful truth, and I will bear it.
      Any evil is better than uncertainty, than lingering hope. Drive all hope
      from my mind. Bid me despair and die&mdash;but do not stretch me on the
      rack of jealousy!&mdash;Yet if such be your cruel pleasure, enjoy it.&mdash;Determine
      how much I can endure and live. Stop just at the point where human nature
      sinks, that you may not lose your victim, that she may linger on from day
      to day, your sport and your derision.

    <p>
      You will rejoice to hear that Olivia and I have been in a state of warfare
      for some days past, and you will be still more pleased when you learn the
      cause of our quarrel. On the day that I had been reading Leonora&rsquo;s letters
      I was rather later at Richmond than usual. Olivia, offended, insisted upon
      knowing by what I could possibly have been detained. Her anger knew no
      bounds when she heard the truth. She made use of some expressions, in
      speaking of my wife, which I could not, I hope, have borne at any time,
      but which shocked me beyond measure at that moment. I defended Leonora
      with warmth. Olivia, in a scornful tone, talked of my wife&rsquo;s coldness of
      disposition, and bid me compare Lady Leonora&rsquo;s love with hers. It was a
      comparison I had it more in my power to make than Olivia was aware of; it
      was the most disadvantageous moment for her in which that comparison could
      be made. She saw or suspected my feelings, and perceived that all she had
      said of my Leonora&rsquo;s <i>incapability of loving</i> produced an effect
      directly contrary to her expectations. Transported by jealousy, she then
      threw out hints respecting the Prince. I spoke as I felt, indignantly. I
      know not precisely what I said, but Olivia and I parted in anger. I have
      since received a passionately fond note from her. But I feel unhappy. Dear
      general, when will you come to town?

    <p>
      Your grace&rsquo;s cautions and entreaties to Lady Leonora not to over-exert and
      fatigue herself were, alas! as ineffectual as mine. From the time she
      heard that Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; had accepted this embassy to Petersburg,
      she was so eager to set out on her journey to town, and so impatient to
      see him, that neither her mind nor her body had one moment&rsquo;s tranquillity.
      She waited with indescribable anxiety for your grace&rsquo;s answer to her
      letter; and the instant she was secure of your approbation, her carriage
      was ordered to the door. I saw that she was ill; but she would not listen
      to my fears; she repeated with triumph, that her mother made no objection
      to her journey, and that she had no apprehensions for herself. However,
      she was obliged at last to yield. The carriage was actually at the door,
      when she was forced to submit to be carried to her bed. For several hours
      she was in such danger, that I never expected she could live till this
      day. Thank God! she is now safe. Her infant, to her great delight, is a
      boy: she was extremely anxious to have a son, because Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;
      formerly wished for one so much. She forbids me to write to Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;,
      lest I should communicate the account of her <i>sudden illness</i> too
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She particularly requests that your grace will mention to him this <i>accident</i>
      in the least alarming manner possible. I shall write again next post. Lady
      Leonora has now fallen asleep, and seems to sleep quietly. Who should
      sleep in peace if she cannot? I never saw her equal,

      MY DEAR GENERAL,
    </h3>
    <p>
      All is upon velvet again. Poor Olivia was excessively hurt by my letter:
      she was ill for two days&mdash;seriously ill. Yesterday I at length
      obtained admittance. Olivia was all softness, all candour: she
      acknowledged that she had been wrong, and in so sweet a voice! She blamed
      herself till I could no longer think her blamable. She seemed so much
      humbled and depressed, such a tender melancholy appeared in her bewitching
      eyes, that I could not resist the fascination. I certainly gave her some
      cause for displeasure that unfortunate evening; for as Olivia has strong
      passions and exquisite sensibility, I should not have been so abrupt. A
      fit of jealousy may seize the best and most generous mind, and may prompt
      to what it would be incapable of saying or thinking in dispassionate
      moments. I am sure that Olivia has, upon reflection, felt more pain from
      this affair than I have. My Russian embassy is still in <i>abeyance</i>.
      Ministers seem to know their own minds as little as I know mine. Ambition
      has its quarrels and follies as well as love. At all events, I shall not
      leave England till next month; and I shall not go down to L&mdash;&mdash;
      Castle till I have received my last instructions from our court, and till
      the day for my sailing is fixed. The parting with Leonora will be a
      dreadful difficulty. I cannot think of it steadily. But as she herself
      says, &ldquo;is it not better that she should lose a year of my affections than
      a life?&rdquo; The Duchess is mistaken in imagining it possible that any woman,
      let her influence be ever so great over my heart, could prejudice me
      against my amiable, my admirable wife. What has just passed between Olivia
      and me, convinces me that it is impossible. She has too much knowledge of
      my character to hazard in future a similar attempt. No, my dear friend, be
      assured I would not suffer it. I have not yet lost all title to your
      esteem or to my own. This enchantress may intoxicate me with her cup, but
      shall never degrade me; and I should feel myself less degraded even by
      losing the human form than by forfeiting that principle of honour and
      virtue, which more nobly distinguishes man from brute.

    <p>
      It is well that I did not answer your letter of Saturday before I received
      that of Monday. My congratulations upon your quarrel with your fair one
      might have come just as you were kissing hands upon a reconciliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have often found a great convenience in writing a bad hand; my letters
      are so little like what they are intended for, and have among them such
      equality of unintelligibility, that each seems either; and with the
      slightest alteration, each will stand and serve for the other. My <i>m</i>,
      <i>n</i>, and <i>u</i>, are convertible letters; so are the terms and
      propositions of your present mode of reasoning, my dear L&mdash;&mdash;,
      and I perceive that you find your account in it. Upon this I congratulate
      you; and I congratulate Lady Leonora upon your being detained some weeks
      longer in England. Those who have a just cause need never pray for
      victory; they need only ask the gods for time. Time always brings victory
      to truth, and shame to falsehood. But you are not worthy of such fine
      apophthegms. At present &ldquo;you are not fit to hear yourself convinced.&rdquo; I
      will wait for a better opportunity, and have patience with you, if I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      You seem to plume yourself mightily upon your resolve to do justice to the
      merits of your wife, and upon the courage you have shown in stuffing
      cotton into your ears to prevent your listening to the voice of the siren:
      but pray take the cotton out, and hear all she can say or sing. Lady
      Leonora cannot be hurt by any thing Olivia can say, but her own malice may
      destroy herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, as you tell me that you are upon velvet again, I am to
      presume that you are perfectly at ease; and I should be obliged to you,
      if, as often as you can find leisure, you would send me bulletins of your
      happiness. I have never yet been in love with one of these high-flown
      heroines, and I am really curious to know what degree of felicity they can
      bestow upon a man of common sense. I should be glad to benefit by the
      experience of a friend.

      more frankly with me, I could, however, have saved you much superfluous
      trouble and artifice. I now perfectly comprehend the cause of poor R&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s
      strange silence some months ago; he was then under the influence of your
      charms, and it was your pleasure to deceive me even when there was no
      necessity for dissimulation. You knew the secret of my growing attachment
      to L&mdash;&mdash;, and must have foreseen that R&mdash;&mdash; would be
      burthensome to me. You needed therefore only to have treated me with
      candour, and you would have gained a lover without losing a friend: but
      Madame de P&mdash;&mdash; is too accomplished a politician to go the
      simple straight road to her object. I now perfectly comprehend why she
      took such pains to persuade me that an imperial lover was alone worthy of

      doubt: I know the precise date of the commencement of your connexion with
      R&mdash;&mdash;, so that you must perceive it will be impracticable to
      make me believe that you have not betrayed my easy confidence.

      I cannot, however, without those pangs of sentiment which your heart will
      never experience, reflect upon the treachery, the perfidy of one who has

      I have just received the most extravagant letter imaginable from your
      Olivia. Really you may congratulate yourself, my dear friend, upon having
      recovered your liberty. &lsquo;Twere better to be a galley slave at once than to
      be bound to please a woman for life, who knows not what she would have
      either in love or friendship. Can you conceive anything so absurd as her
      upbraiding me with treachery, because I know the value of a heart, of

      <i>Ennui</i>, and dandled in turn by all the Vices.

      And this Lady Olivia fancies that she is a perfect French woman! There is
      nothing we Parisians abhor and ridicule so much as these foreign, and
      always awkward, caricatures of our manners. With us there are many who,
      according to a delicate distinction, lose their virtue without losing
      their taste for virtue; but I flatter myself there are few who resemble
      Olivia entirely&mdash;who have neither the virtues of a man nor of a
      woman. One cannot even say that &ldquo;her head is the dupe of her heart,&rdquo; since
      she has no heart. But enough of such a tiresome and incomprehensible
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      How I overvalued that head, when I thought it could ever be fit for
      politics! &lsquo;Tis well we did not commit ourselves. You see how prudent I am,
      my dear R&mdash;&mdash;, and how much those are mistaken who think that we
      women are not fit to be trusted with secrets of state. Love and politics
      make the best mixture in the world. Adieu. Victoire summons me to my
      toilette.

      Really, my dear Olivia, this is too childish. What! make a complaint in
      form against me for taking a lover off your hands when you did not know
      what to do with him! Do you quarrel in England every time you change
      partners in a country dance? But I must be serious; for the high-sounding
      words <i>treachery</i> and <i>perfidy</i> are surely sufficient to make
      any body grave. Seriously, then, if you are resolved to be tragical, <i>et

      Tuesday evening.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain to you the cause of my melancholy &ldquo;&mdash;Vain request!&mdash;cruel
      as vain! Your ignorance of the cause too well justifies my sad
      presentiments. Were our feelings in unison, as once they were, would not
      every chord of your heart vibrate responsively to mine?
    </p>
    <p>
      With me, love is an absorbing vortex of the soul, into which all other
      thoughts, feelings, and ideas are irresistibly impelled; with you, it is
      but as the stranger stream that crosses the peaceful lake, and, as it
      flows, wakens only the surface of the slumbering waters, communicating to
      them but a temporary agitation. With you, my dear, but too tranquil-minded
      friend, love is but one amid the vulgar crowd of pleasures; it
      concentrates not your ideas, it entrances not your faculties; it is not,
      as in my heart, the supreme delight, which renders all others tasteless,
      the only blessing which can make life supportable; the sole, sufficient
      object of existence. Alas! how cruelly different is the feeble attachment
      that I have inspired from that all-powerful sentiment to which I live a
      victim! Countless symptoms, by you unheeded, mark to my love-watchful eye
      the decline of passion. How often am I secretly shocked by the cold
      carelessness of your words and manner! How often does the sigh burst from
      my bosom, the tear fall from my eye, when you have left me at leisure to
      recall, by memory&rsquo;s torturing power, instances of your increasing
      indifference! Seek not to calm my too well-founded fears. Professions,
      with all their unmeaning, inanimate formality, but irritate my anguish.
      Permit me to indulge, to feed upon my grief in silence. Ask me no more to
      explain to you the cause of my melancholy. Too plainly, alas! I feel it is
      beyond my utmost power to endure it. Amiable Werter&mdash;divine St. Preux&mdash;you
      would sympathize in my feelings! Sublime Goethe&mdash;all-eloquent

    <p>
      Expect no bulletin of happiness from me, my friend. I find it impossible
      to make Olivia happy. She has superior talents, accomplishments, beauty,
      grace, all that can attract and fascinate the human heart&mdash;that could
      triumph over every feeling, every principle that opposed her power: she
      lives with the man she loves, and yet she is miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rousseau, it has been said, never really loved any woman but his own
      Julie; I have lately been tempted to think that Olivia never really loved
      any man but St. Preux. Werter, perhaps, and some other German heroes,
      might dispute her heart even with St. Preux; but as for me, I begin to be
      aware that I am loved only as a feeble resemblance of those divine
      originals (to whom, however, my character bears not the slightest
      similarity), and I am often indirectly, and sometimes directly, reproached
      with my inferiority to imaginary models. But how can a plain Englishman
      hope to reach
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The high sublime of deep absurd?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I am continually reviled for not using a romantic language, which I have
      never learned; and which, as far as I can judge, is foreign to all natural
      feeling. I wish to make Olivia happy. There is nothing I would not do to
      satisfy her of my sincerity; but nothing I can do will suffice. She has a
      sort of morbid sensibility, which is more alive to pain than pleasure,
      more susceptible of jealousy than of love. No terms are sufficiently
      strong to convince her of my affection, but an unguarded word makes her
      miserable for hours. She requires to be agitated by violent emotions,
      though they exhaust her mind, and leave her spiritless and discontented.
      In this alternation of rapture and despair all her time passes. As she
      says of herself, she has no soul but for love: she seems to think it a
      crime against sentiment, to admit of relief from common occupations or
      indifferent subjects; with a sort of superstitious zeal, she excludes all
      thoughts but those which relate to one object, and in this spirit of
      amorous mysticism she actually makes a penance even of love. I am
      astonished that her heart can endure this variety of self-inflicted
      torments. What will become of Olivia when she ceases to love and be loved?
      And what passion can be durable which is so violent as hers, and to which
      no respite is allowed? No affection can sustain these hourly trials of
      suspicion and reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jealousy of Leonora has taken such possession of Olivia&rsquo;s imagination,
      that she misinterprets all my words and actions. By restraining my
      thoughts, by throwing obstacles in the way of my affection for my wife,
      she stimulates and increases it: she forces upon me continually those
      comparisons which she dreads. Till I knew Olivia more intimately than the
      common forms of a first acquaintance, or the illusions of a treacherous
      passion permitted, her defects did not appear; but now that I suffer, and
      that I see her suffer daily, I deplore them bitterly. Her happiness rests
      and weighs heavily on my honour. I feel myself bound to consider and to
      provide for the happiness of the woman who has sacrificed to me all
      independent means of felicity. A man without honour or humanity may
      perhaps finish an intrigue as easily as he can begin it, but this is not
      exactly the case of your imprudent friend,

      You presume too much upon your power over my heart, and upon the softness

      that will neither be injured nor insulted with impunity. You were amazed,

      that violence by opposing the warmest wish of my heart, and with a
      calmness that excited my tenfold indignation? Imagine not that I am a
      tame, subjugated female, to be treated with neglect if I remonstrate, and
      caressed as the price of obedience. Fancy not that I am one of your
      chimney-corner, household goddesses, doomed to the dull uniformity of
      domestic worship, destined to to be adored, to be hung with garlands, or
      undeified or degraded with indignity! I have been accustomed to a
      different species of worship; and the fondness of my weak heart has not
      yet sunk me so low, and rendered me so abject, that I cannot assert my
      rights. You tell me that you are unconscious of giving me any just cause
      of offence. Just cause!&mdash;How I hate the cold accuracy of your words!
      This single expression is sufficient offence to a heart like mine. You
      entreat me to be reasonable. Reasonable!&mdash;did ever man talk of reason
      to a woman he loved? When once a man has recourse to reason and precision,
      there is an end of love. No just cause of offence!&mdash;What, have I no

      Amuse yourself, my good general, at my expense; I know that you are
      seriously interested for my happiness; but the way is not quite so clear
      before me as you imagine. It is extremely easy to be philosophic for our
      friends; but difficult to be so for ourselves when our passions are
      concerned. Indeed, this would be a contradiction in terms; you might as
      well talk of a cold sun, or of hot ice, as of a philosopher falling in
      love, or of a man in love being a philosopher. You say that Olivia will
      wear out my passion, and that her defects will undo the work of her
      charms. I acknowledge that she sometimes ravels the web she has woven; but
      she is miraculously expeditious and skilful in repairing the mischief: the
      magical tissue again appears firm as ever, glowing with brighter colours,
      and exhibiting finer forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In plain prose, my dear friend&mdash;for as you ate not in love, you will
      find it difficult to follow my poetic nights&mdash;in plain prose, I must
      confess that Olivia has the power to charm and touch my heart, even after
      she has provoked me to the utmost verge of human patience. She knows her
      power, and I am afraid this tempts her to abuse it. Her temper, which
      formerly appeared to me all feminine gentleness, is now irritable and
      violent; but I am persuaded that this is not her natural disposition; it
      is the effect of her present unhappy state of mind. Tortured by remorse
      and jealousy, if in the height of their paroxysms, Olivia make me suffer
      from their fury, is it for me to complain? I, who caused, should at least
      endure the evil.

    <p>
      I am in despair, dear Victoire; and unless your genius can assist me,
      absolutely undone! Here is this romantic lady of mine determined upon a
      journey to Russia with her new English lover. What whims ladies take into
      their heads, and how impossible it is to make them understand reason! I
      have been labouring in vain to convince my Lady Olivia that this is the
      most absurd scheme imaginable: and I have repeated to her all I learnt
      from Lady F&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s women, who are just returned from Petersburg,
      and whom I met at a party last night, all declaring they would rather die
      a thousand deaths, than go through again what they have endured. Such seas
      of ice! such going in sledges! such barbarians! such beds! and scarcely a
      looking-glass! And nothing fit to wear but what one carries with one, and
      God knows how long we may stay. At Petersburg the coachmen&rsquo;s ears are
      frozen off every night on their boxes waiting for their ladies. And there
      are bears and wild beasts, I am told, howling with their mouths wide open
      night and day in the forests which we are to pass through; and even in the
      towns, the men, I hear, are little better; for it is the law of the
      country for the men to beat their wives, and many wear long beards. How
      horrid!&mdash;My Lady F&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s woman, who is a Parisian born, and
      very pretty, if her eyes were not so small, and better dressed than her
      lady always, except diamonds, assures me, upon her honour, she never had a
      civil thing said to her whilst she was in Russia, except by one or two
      Frenchmen in the suite of the ambassadors.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Russians think of nothing but drinking brandy, and they put pepper
      into it! Mon Dieu, what savages! Put pepper into brandy! But that is
      inconceivable! Positively, I will never go to Petersburg. And yet if my
      lady goes, what will become of me? for you know my sentiments for Brunel,
      and he is decided to accompany my lady, so I cannot stay behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But absolutely I am shocked at this intrigue with Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, and
      my conscience reproaches me terribly with being a party concerned in it;
      for in this country an affair of gallantry between married people is not
      so light a thing as with us. Here wives sometimes love their husbands
      seriously, as if they were their lovers; and my Lady Leonora L&mdash;&mdash;
      is one of this sort of wives. She is very unhappy, I am told. One day at L&mdash;&mdash;Castle,
      I assure you my heart quite bled for her, when she gave me a beautiful
      gown of English muslin, little suspecting me then to be her enemy. She is
      certainly very unsuspicious, and very amiable, and I wish to Heaven her
      husband would think as I do, and take her with him to Petersburg, instead
      of carrying off my Lady Olivia and me! Adieu, mon chou! Embrace every body
      I know, tenderly, for me.

    <h3>
      MY DEAR MADAM,
    </h3>
    <p>
      I believe, when I wrote last to your grace, I said that I had no hopes of
      the child&rsquo;s life. From the moment of his birth there was but little
      probability of his being any thing but a source of misery to his mother. I
      cannot, on her account, regret that the struggle is over. He expired this
      morning. My poor friend had hopes to the last, though I had none; and it
      was most painful and alarming to see the feverish anxiety with which she
      watched over her little boy, frequently repeating, &ldquo;Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;
      used to wish so much for a son.&mdash;I hope the boy will live to see his
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Last night, partly by persuasion, partly by compulsion, I prevailed with
      her to let the child be taken out of her room. This morning, as soon as it
      was light, I heard her bell ring; the poor little thing was at that moment
      in convulsions; and knowing that Lady Leonora rang to inquire for it, I
      went to prepare her mind for what I knew must be the event. The moment I
      came into the room she looked eagerly in my face, but did not ask me any
      questions about the child. I sat down by the side of her bed; but without
      listening to what I said about her own health, she rang her bell again
      more violently than before. Susan came in. &ldquo;Susan!&mdash;without my
      child!&rdquo;&mdash;said she, starting up. Susan hesitated, but I saw by her
      countenance that it was all over&mdash;so did Lady Leonora. She said not a
      word, but drawing her curtain suddenly, she lay down, and never spoke or
      stirred for three hours. The first words she said afterwards were to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not move so softly, my dear Helen; I am not asleep. Have you my
      mother&rsquo;s last letter? I think my mother says that she will be here
      to-morrow? She is very kind to come to me. Will you be so good as to write
      to her immediately, and send a servant with your letter as soon as you can
      to meet her on the road, that she may not be <i>surprised</i> when she
      arrives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Leonora is now more composed and more like herself than she has been
      for some time past. I rejoice that your Grace will so soon be here,
      because you will be her best possible consolation; and I do not know any
      other person in the world who could have sufficient influence to prevent
      her from attempting to set out upon a journey before she can travel with
      safety. To do her justice, she has not hinted that such were her
      intentions; but still I know her mind so well, that I am certain what her
      thoughts are, and what her actions would be. Most ladies talk more than
      they act, but Leonora acts more decidedly than she talks.

      LETTER LXXXV.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      MR. L&mdash;&mdash; TO GENERAL B&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I thank you, my excellent friend, for the kindness of your last letter
      {1}, which came to me at the time I wanted it most. In the whole course of
      my life, I never felt so much self-reproach, as I have done since I heard
      of the illness of Leonora and the loss of my son. From this blow my mind
      will not easily recover. Of all torments self-reproach is the worst. And
      even now I cannot follow the dictates of my own heart, and of my better
      judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Olivia&rsquo;s company I am compelled to repress my feelings; she cannot
      sympathize in them; they offend her: she is dissatisfied even with my
      silence, and complains of my being out of spirits. Out of spirits!&mdash;How
      can I be otherwise at present? Has Olivia no touch of pity for a woman who
      was once her friend, who always treated her with generous kindness? But
      perhaps I am a little unreasonable, and expect too much from female
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all events, I wish that Olivia would spare me at this moment her
      sentimental metaphysics. She is for ever attempting to prove to me that I
      cannot love so well as she can. I admit that I cannot talk of love so
      finely. I hope all this will not go on when we arrive at Petersburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ministry at last know their own minds. I saw &mdash;&mdash; to-day,
      and every thing will be quickly arranged; therefore, my dear friend, do

      GENERAL B&mdash;&mdash; TO MR. L&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Perhaps you are a <i>little</i> unreasonable! Indeed, my dear friend, I do
      not think you a <i>little</i> unreasonable, but very nearly stark mad.
      What! quarrel with your mistress because she is not sorry that your wife
      is ill, and because she cannot sympathize in your grief for the loss of
      your son! Where, except perhaps in absurd novels, did you ever meet with
      these paragons of mistresses, who were so magnanimous and so generous as
      to sacrifice their own reputations, and then be satisfied to share the
      only possible good remaining to them in life, the heart of their lover,
      with a rival more estimable, more amiable than themselves, and who has the
      advantage of being a wife? This sharing of hearts, this union of souls,
      with this opposition of interests&mdash;this metaphysical gallantry is
      absolute nonsense, and all who try it in real life will find it so to
      their cost. Why should you, my dear L&mdash;&mdash;, expect such
      superlative excellence from your Olivia? Do you think that a woman by
      losing one virtue increases the strength of those that remain, as it is
      said that the loss of one of our senses renders all the others more acute?
      Do you think that a lady, by yielding to love, and by proving that she has
      not sufficient resolution or forbearance to preserve the honour of her
      sex, gives the best possible demonstration of her having sufficient
      strength of character to rise superior to all the other weaknesses
      incident to human, and more especially to female nature&mdash;envy and
      jealousy for instance?
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no, my good friend, you have common sense, though you lately have been
      sparing of it in action. You had a wife, and a good wife, and you had some
      chance of being happy; but with a wife and a mistress, granting them to be
      both the best of their kind, the probabilities are rather against you. I
      speak only as a man of the world: morality, you know, is now merely an
      affair of calculation. According to the most approved tables of happiness,
      you have made a bad bargain. But be just, at any rate, and do not blame
      your Olivia for the inconveniences and evils inseparable from the species
      of connexion that you have been pleased to form. Do you expect the whole
      course of society and the nature of the human heart to change for your
      special accommodation? Do you believe in truth by wholesale, and yet in
      detail expect a happy exception in your own favour?&mdash;Seriously, my
      dear friend, you must either break off this connexion, or bear it. I shall
      see you in a few days.

      Leonora has recovered her strength surprisingly. She was so determined to
      be well, that her body dared not contradict her mind. Her excellent mother
      has been of the greatest possible service to us, for she has had
      sufficient influence to prevent her daughter from exerting herself too
      much. Her Grace had a letter from Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; to-day&mdash;very
      short, but very kind&mdash;at least all that I heard read of it. He has
      set my heart somewhat more at ease by the comfortable assurance, that he
      will not leave England without seeing Lady Leonora. I have the greatest
      hopes from this interview! I have not felt so happy for many months&mdash;but
      I will not be too sanguine. Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; talks of being here the
      latter end of this month. The duchess, with her usual prudence, intends to
      leave her daughter before that time, lest Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;should be
      constrained by her presence, or should imagine that Leonora acts from any
      impulse but that of her own heart. I also, though much against my
      inclination, shall decamp; for he might perhaps consider me as an adviser,
      caballer, confidante, or at least a troublesome spectator. All
      reconciliation scenes should be without spectators. Men do not like to be
      seen on their knees: they are at a loss, like Sir Walter Raleigh in &ldquo;The

      MY DEAR L&mdash;&mdash;, Friday.

    <p>
      Ask yourself, in the name of common sense, why you should go to Petersburg
      with this sentimental coquette, this romantic termagant, of whom I see you
      are already more than half tired. As to your being bound to her in honour,
      I cannot see how. Why should you make honour, justice, humanity, and
      gratitude, plead so finely all on one side, and that the wrong side of the
      question? Have none of these one word to whisper in favour of any body in
      this world but of a worthless mistress, who makes you miserable? I think
      you have learned from your heroine to be so expert in sentimental logic,
      that you can change virtues into vices, and vices into virtues, till at
      last you do not know them asunder. Else why should you make it a point of
      conscience to abandon your wife&mdash;just at the moment, too, when you
      are thoroughly convinced of her love for you, when you are touched to the
      soul by her generous conduct, and when your heart longs to return to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Please to remember that this Lady Olivia&rsquo;s reputation was not unimpeached
      before her acquaintance with you, and do not take more glory or more blame
      to yourself than properly falls to your share. Do not forget that <i>poor</i>
      R&mdash;&mdash; was your predecessor, and do not let this delicate lady
      rest all the weight of her shame upon you, as certain Chinese culprits
      rest their portable pillories on the shoulders of their friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      In two days I shall follow this letter, and repeat in person all the
      interrogatories I have just put to you, my dear friend. Prepare yourself
      to answer me sincerely such questions as I shall ask.

      Thursday.

    <p>
      My Dear Friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      You have by argument and raillery, and by every means that kindness and
      goodness could devise, endeavoured to expel from my mind a passion which
      you justly foresaw would be destructive of my happiness, and of the peace
      of a most estimable and amiable woman. With all the skill that a thorough
      knowledge of human nature in general, and of my peculiar character and
      foibles, could bestow, you have employed those
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &mdash;&ldquo;Words and spells which can control,
  Between the fits, the fever of the soul.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Circumstances have operated in conjunction with your skill to &ldquo;medicine me
      to repose.&rdquo; The fits have gradually become weaker and weaker, the fever is
      now gone, but I am still to suffer for the extravagances committed during
      its delirium. I have entered into engagements which must be fulfilled; I
      have involved myself in difficulties from which I see no method of
      extricating myself honourably. Notwithstanding all the latitude which the
      system of modern gallantry allows to the conscience of our sex, and in
      spite of the convenient maxim, which maintains that all arts are allowable
      in love and war, I think that a man cannot break a promise, whether made
      in words or by tacit implication, on the faith of which a woman sacrifices
      her reputation and happiness. Lady Olivia has thrown herself upon my
      protection. I am as sensible as you can be, my dear general, that scandal
      had attacked her reputation before our acquaintance commenced; but though
      the world had suspicions, they had no proofs: now there can be no longer
      any defence made for her character, there is no possibility of her
      returning to that rank in society to which she was entitled by her birth,
      and which she adorned with all the brilliant charms of wit and beauty; no
      happiness, no chance of happiness remains for her but from my constancy.
      Of naturally violent passions, unused to the control of authority, habit,
      reason, or religion, and at this time impelled by love and jealousy,
      Olivia is on the brink of despair. I am not apt to believe that women die
      in modern times for love, nor am I easily disposed to think that I could
      inspire a dangerous degree of enthusiasm; yet I am persuaded that Olivia&rsquo;s
      passion, compounded as it is of various sentiments besides love, has taken
      such possession of her imagination, and is, as she fancies, so necessary
      to her existence, that if I were to abandon her, she would destroy that
      life, which she has already attempted, I thank God! ineffectually. What a
      spectacle is a woman in a paroxysm of rage!&mdash;a woman we love, or whom
      we have loved!

    <p>
      Excuse me, my dear friend, if I wrote incoherently, for I have been
      interrupted many times since I began this letter. I am this day
      overwhelmed by a multiplicity of affairs, which, in consequence of
      Olivia&rsquo;s urgency to leave England immediately, must be settled with an
      expedition for which my head is not at present well qualified. I do not
      feel well: I can command my attention but on one subject, and on that all
      my thoughts are to no purpose. Whichever way I now act, I must endure and
      inflict misery. I must either part from a wife who has given me the most
      tender, the most touching proofs of affection&mdash;a wife who is all that
      a man can esteem, admire, and love; or I must abandon a mistress, who
      loves me with all the desperation of passion to which she would fall a
      sacrifice. But why do I talk as if I were still at liberty to make a
      choice?&mdash;My head is certainly very confused. I forgot that I am bound
      by a solemn promise, and this is the evil which distracts me. I will give
      you, if I can, a clear narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last night I had a terrible scene with Olivia. I foresaw that she would be
      alarmed by my intended visit to L&mdash;&mdash; Castle, even though it was
      but to take leave of my Leonora. I abstained from seeing Olivia to avoid
      altercation, and with all the delicacy in my power I wrote to her,
      assuring her that my resolution was fixed. Note after note came from her,
      with pathetic and passionate appeals to my heart; but I was still
      resolute. At length, the day before that on which I was to set out for L&mdash;&mdash;
      Castle, she wrote to warn me, that if I wished to take a last farewell, I
      must see her that evening: her note concluded with, &ldquo;To-morrow&rsquo;s sun will
      not rise for Olivia.&rdquo; This threat, and many strange hints of her opinions
      concerning suicide, I at the time disregarded, as only thrown out to
      intimidate a lover. However, knowing the violence of Olivia&rsquo;s temper, I
      was punctual to the appointed hour, fully determined by my firmness to
      convince her that these female wiles were vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear friend, I would not advise the wisest man and the most courageous
      upon earth to risk such dangers, confident in his strength. Even a victory
      may cost him too dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Olivia reclining on a sofa, her beautiful tresses unbound, her
      dress the perfection of elegant negligence. I half suspected that it was
      studied negligence: yet I could not help pausing, as I entered, to
      contemplate a figure. She never looked more beautiful&mdash;more
      fascinating. Holding out her hand to me, she said, with her languid smile,
      and tender expression of voice and manner, &ldquo;You <i>are</i> come then to
      bid me farewell. I doubted whether... But I will not upbraid&mdash;mine be
      all the pain of this last adieu. During the few minutes we have to pass
      together,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;Between us two let there be peace.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I sat down beside her, rather agitated, I confess, but commanding myself
      so that my emotion could not be visible. In a composed tone I asked, why
      she spoke of a last adieu? and observed that we should meet again in a few
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; replied Olivia. &ldquo;Weak woman as I am, love inspires me with
      sufficient force to make and to keep this resolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, she took from her bosom a rose, and presenting it to me in a
      solemn manner, &ldquo;Put this rose into water to-night,&rdquo; continued she;
      &ldquo;to-morrow it will be alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her look, her expressive eyes, seemed to say, this flower will be alive,
      but Olivia will be dead. I am ashamed to confess that I was silent,
      because I could not just then speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have used some precaution,&rdquo; resumed Olivia, &ldquo;to spare you, my dearest L&mdash;&mdash;,
      unnecessary pain.&mdash;Look around you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The room, I now for the first time observed, was ornamented with flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This apartment, I hope,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;has not the air of the chamber
      of death. I have endeavoured to give it a festive appearance, that the
      remembrance of your last interview with your once loved Olivia may be at
      least unmixed with horror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this instant, my dear general, a confused recollection of Rousseau&rsquo;s
      Heloise, the dying scene, and her room ornamented with flowers, came into
      my imagination, and destroying the idea of reality, changed suddenly the
      whole course of my feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a tone of raillery I represented to Olivia her resemblance to Julie,
      and observed that it was a pity she had not a lover whose temper was more
      similar than mine to that of the divine St. Preux. Stung to the heart by
      my ill-timed raillery, Olivia started up from the sofa, broke from my arms
      with sudden force, snatched from the table a penknife, and plunged it into
      her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was about to repeat the blow, but I caught her arm&mdash;she struggled&mdash;&ldquo;promise
      me, then,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;that you will never more see my hated rival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot make such a promise, Olivia,&rdquo; said I, holding her uplifted arm
      forcibly. &ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words &ldquo;hated rival,&rdquo; which showed me that Olivia was actuated more by
      the spirit of hatred than love, made me reply in as decided a tone as even
      you could have spoken, my dear general. But I was shocked, and reproached
      myself with cruelty, when I saw the blood flow from her side: she was
      terrified. I took the knife from her powerless hand, and she fainted in my
      arms. I had sufficient presence of mind to reflect that what had happened
      should be kept as secret as possible; therefore, without summoning
      Josephine, whose attachment to her mistress I have reason to suspect, I
      threw open the windows, gave Olivia air and water, and her senses
      returned: then I despatched my Swiss for a surgeon. I need not speak of my
      own feelings&mdash;no suspense could be more dreadful than that which I
      endured between the sending for the surgeon and the moment when he gave
      his opinion. He relieved me at once, by pronouncing it to be a slight
      flesh wound, that would be of no manner of consequence. Olivia, however,
      whether from alarm or pain, or from the sight of the blood, fainted three
      times during the dressing of her side; and though the surgeon assured her
      that it would be perfectly well in a few days, she was evidently
      apprehensive that we concealed from her the real danger. At the idea of
      the approach of death, which now took possession of her imagination, all
      courage forsook her, and for some time my efforts to support her spirits
      were ineffectual. She could not dispense with the services of Josephine;
      and from the moment this French woman entered the room, there was nothing
      to be heard but exclamations the most violent and noisy. As to assistance,
      she could give none. At last her exaggerated demonstrations of horror and
      grief ended with,&mdash;&ldquo;Dieu merci! an moins nous voilà delivrés de ce
      voyage affreux. Apparemment qu&rsquo;il ne sera plus question de ce vilain
      Petersburg pour madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A new train of thoughts was roused by these words in Olivia&rsquo;s mind; and
      looking at me, she eagerly inquired why the journey to Petersburg was to
      be given up, if she was in no danger? I assured her that Josephine spoke
      at random, that my intentions with regard to the embassy to Russia were
      unaltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seulement retardé un peu,&rdquo; said Josephine, who was intent only upon her
      own selfish object.&mdash;&ldquo;Sûrement, madame ne voyagera pas dans cet
      état!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olivia started up, and looking at me with terrific wildness in her eyes,
      &ldquo;Swear to me,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;swear that you will not deceive me, or I will
      this instant tear open this wound, and never more suffer it to be closed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deceive you, Olivia!&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;what deceit can you fear from me?&mdash;What
      is it you require of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I require from you a promise, a solemn promise, that you will go with <i>me</i>
      to Russia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I solemnly promise that I will,&rdquo; said I: &ldquo;now be tranquil, Olivia, I
      beseech you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon represented the necessity of keeping herself quiet, and
      declared that he would not answer for the cure of his patient on any other
      terms. Satisfied by the solemnity of my promise, Olivia now suffered me to
      depart. This morning she sends me word that in a few days she shall be
      ready to leave England. Can you meet me, my dear friend, at L&mdash;&mdash;
      Castle? I go down there to-day, to bid adieu to Leonora. From thence I
      shall proceed to Yarmouth, and embark immediately. Olivia will follow me.

    <p>
      Dearest Mother,
    </p>
    <p>
      My husband is here! at home with me, with your happy Leonora&mdash;and his
      heart is with her. His looks, his voice, his manner tell me so, and by
      them I never was deceived. No, he is incapable of deceit. Whatever have
      been his errors, he never stooped to dissimulation. He is again my own,
      still capable of loving me, still worthy of all my affection. I knew that
      the delusion could not last long, or rather you told me so, my best
      friend, and I believed you; you did him justice. He was indeed deceived&mdash;who
      might not have been deceived by Olivia? His passions were under the power
      of an enchantress; but now he has triumphed over her arts. He sees her
      such as she is, and her influence ceases.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not absolutely certain of all this; but I believe, because I hope it:
      yet he is evidently embarrassed, and seems unhappy: what can be the
      meaning of this? Perhaps he does not yet know his Leonora sufficiently to
      be secure of her forgiveness. How I long to set his heart at ease, and to
      say to him, let the past be forgotten for ever! How easy it is to the
      happy to forgive! There have been moments when I could not, I fear, have
      been just, when I am sure that I could not have been generous. I shall
      immediately offer to accompany Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; to Russia; I can have
      no farther hesitation, for I see that he wishes it; indeed, just now he
      almost said so. His baggage is already embarked at Yarmouth&mdash;he sails
      in a few days&mdash;and in a few hours your daughter&rsquo;s fate, your
      daughter&rsquo;s happiness, will be decided. It is decided, for I am sure he
      loves me; I see, I hear, I feel it. Dearest mother, I write to you in the
      first moment of joy.&mdash;I hear his foot upon the stairs.

    <h3>
      MY DEAR MOTHER,
    </h3>
    <p>
      My hopes are all vain. Your prophecies will never be accomplished. We have
      both been mistaken in Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s character, and henceforward
      your daughter must not depend upon him for any portion of her happiness. I
      once thought it impossible that my love for him could be diminished: he
      has changed my opinion. Mine is not that species of weak or abject
      affection which can exist under the sense of ill-treatment and injustice,
      much less can my love survive esteem for its object.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told you, my dear mother, and I believed, that his affections had
      returned to me; but I was mistaken. He has not sufficient strength or
      generosity of soul to love me, or to do justice to my love. I offered to
      go with him to Russia: he answered, &ldquo;That is impossible.&rdquo;&mdash;Impossible!&mdash;Is
      it then impossible for him to do that which is just or honourable? or
      seeing what is right, must he follow what is wrong? or can his heart never
      more be touched by virtuous affections? Is his taste so changed, so
      depraved, that he can now be pleased and charmed only by what is
      despicable and profligate in our sex? Then I should rejoice that we are to
      be separated&mdash;separated for ever. May years and years pass away and
      wear out, if possible, the memory of all he has been to me! I think I
      could better, much better bear the total loss, the death of him I have
      loved, than endure to feel that he had survived both my affection and
      esteem; to see the person the same, but the soul changed; to feel every
      day, every hour, that I must despise what I have so admired and loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; is gone from hence. He leaves England the day after
      to-morrow. Lady Olivia is to <i>follow</i> him. I am glad that public
      decency is not to be outraged by their embarking together. My dearest
      mother, be assured that at this moment your daughter&rsquo;s feelings are worthy
      of you. Indignation and the pride of virtue support her spirit.

    <h3>
      GENERAL B&mdash;&mdash; TO LADY LEONORA L&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Yarmouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had I not the highest confidence in Lady Leonora L&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s
      fortitude, I should not venture to write to her at this moment, knowing as
      I do that she is but just recovered from a dangerous illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; had requested me to meet him at L&mdash;&mdash; Castle
      previously to his leaving England, but it was out of my power. I met him
      however on the road to Yarmouth, and as we travelled together I had full
      opportunity of seeing the state of his mind. Permit me&mdash;the urgency
      of the case requires it&mdash;to speak without reserve, with the freedom
      of an old friend. I imagine that your ladyship parted from Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;
      with feelings of indignation, at which I cannot be surprised: but if you
      had seen him as I saw him, indignation would have given way to pity.
      Loving you, madam, as you deserve to be loved, most ardently, most
      tenderly; touched to his inmost soul by the proofs of affection he had
      seen in your letters, in your whole conduct, even to the last moment of
      parting; my unhappy friend felt himself bound to resist the temptation of
      staying with you, or of accepting your generous offer to accompany him to
      Petersburg. He thought himself bound in honour by a promise extorted from
      him to save from suicide one whom he thinks he has injured, one who has
      thrown herself upon his protection. Of the conflict in his mind at parting
      with your ladyship I can judge from what he suffered afterwards. I met Mr.
      L&mdash;&mdash; with feelings of extreme indignation, but before I had
      been an hour in his company, I never pitied any man so much in my life,
      for I never yet saw any one so truly wretched, and so thoroughly convinced
      that he deserved to be so. You know that he is not one who often gives way
      to his emotions, not one who expresses them much in words&mdash;but he
      could not command his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The struggle was too violent. I have no doubt that it was the real cause
      of his present illness. As the moment approached when he was to leave
      England, he became more and more agitated. Towards evening he sunk into a
      sort of apathy and gloomy silence, from which he suddenly broke into
      delirious raving. At twelve o&rsquo;clock last night, the night he was to have
      sailed, he was seized with a violent and infectious fever. As to the
      degree of immediate danger, the physicians here cannot yet pronounce. I
      have sent to town for Dr. &mdash;&mdash;. Your ladyship may be certain
      that I shall not quit my friend, and that he shall have every possible
      assistance and attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am, with the truest esteem,
    </p>
    <p>
      Your ladyship&rsquo;s faithful servant,

      GENERAL B&mdash;&mdash; TO THE DUCHESS OF &mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      MY DEAR MADAM, Yarmouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your Grace, I find, is apprised of Lady Leonora L&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s journey
      hither: I fear that you rely upon my prudence for preventing her exposing
      herself to the danger of catching this dreadful fever. But that has been
      beyond my power. Her ladyship arrived late last night. I had foreseen the
      probability of her coming, but not the possibility of her coming so soon.
      I had taken no precautions, and she was in the house and upon the stairs
      in an instant. No entreaties, no arguments could stop her; I assured her
      that Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s fever was pronounced by all the physicians to
      be of the most infectious kind. Dr. &mdash;&mdash; joined me in
      representing that she would expose her life to almost certain danger if
      she persisted in her determination to see her husband; but she pressed
      forward, regardless of all that could be said. To the physicians she made
      no answer; to me she replied, &ldquo;You are Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s friend, but I
      am his wife: you have not feared to hazard your life for him, and do you
      think I can hesitate?&rdquo; I urged that there was no necessity for more than
      one person&rsquo;s running this hazard; and that since it had fallen to my lot
      to be with my friend when he was first taken ill&mdash;She interrupted me,&mdash;&ldquo;Is
      not this taking a cruel advantage of me, general? You know that I, too,
      would have been with Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, if&mdash;if it had been
      possible.&rdquo; Her manner, her pathetic emphasis, and the force of her implied
      meaning, struck me so much, that I was silent, and suffered her to pass
      on; but again the idea of her danger rushing upon my mind, I sprang before
      her to the door of Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s apartment, and opposed her
      entrance. &ldquo;Then, general,&rdquo; said she, calmly, &ldquo;perhaps you mistake me&mdash;perhaps
      you have heard repeated some unguarded words of mine in the moment of
      indignation ... unjust ... you best know how unjust indignation!&mdash;and
      you infer from these that my affection for my husband is extinguished. I
      deserve this&mdash;but do not punish me too severely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I still kept my hand upon the lock of the door, expostulating with Lady
      Leonora in your Grace&rsquo;s name, and in Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s, assuring her
      that if he were conscious of what was passing, and able to speak, he would
      order me to prevent her seeing him in his present situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, too, general!&rdquo; said she, bursting into tears: &ldquo;I thought you
      were my friend&mdash;would you prevent me from seeing him? And is not he
      conscious of what is passing? And is not he able to speak? Sir, I must be
      admitted! You have done your duty&mdash;now let me do mine. Consider, my
      right is superior to yours. No power on earth should or can prevent a wife
      from seeing her husband when he is.... Dear, dear general!&rdquo; said she,
      clasping her raised hands, and falling suddenly at my feet, &ldquo;let me see
      him but for one minute, and I will be grateful to you for ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could resist no longer&mdash;I tremble for the consequences. I know your
      Grace sufficiently to be aware that you ought to be told the whole truth.
      I have but little hopes of my poor friend&rsquo;s life.
    </p>
    <p>
      With much respect,

      A mist hung over my eyes, and &ldquo;my ears with hollow murmurs rung,&rdquo; when the
      dreadful tidings of your alarming illness were announced by your cruel
      messenger. My dearest L&mdash;&mdash;! why does inexorable destiny doom me

      would, I fear, certainly open again if I were to travel. So this corporeal

      My husband is alive, and that is all. Never did I see, nor could I have
      conceived, such a change, and in so short a time! When I opened the door,
      his eyes turned upon me with unmeaning eagerness: he did not know me. The
      good general thought my voice might have some effect. I spoke, but could
      obtain no answer, no sign of intelligence. In vain I called upon him by
      every name that used to reach his heart. I kneeled beside him, and took
      one of his burning hands in mine. I kissed it, and suddenly he started up,
      exclaiming, &ldquo;Olivia! Olivia!&rdquo; with dreadful vehemence. In his delirium he
      raved about Olivia&rsquo;s stabbing herself, and called upon us to hold her arm,
      looking wildly towards the foot of the bed, as if the figure were actually
      before him. Then he sunk back, as if quite exhausted, and gave a deep
      sigh. Some of my tears fell upon his hand; he felt them before I perceived
      that they had fallen, and looked so earnestly in my face, that I was in
      hopes his recollection was returning; but he only said, &ldquo;Olivia, I believe
      that you love me;&rdquo; then sighed more deeply than before, drew his hand away
      from me, and, as well as I could distinguish, said something about
      Leonora.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why should I give you the pain of hearing all these circumstances, my

      Words cannot express what I have suffered since I wrote last! Oh! why do I

      assures me that my fears of my wound opening, were I to take so long a

      urge that my rashness might prove our mutual ruin&mdash;that in the moment
      of crisis or of convalescence, anxiety for me might defeat the kind

      winds would waft you from me. The waves would bear you to another region,

      MY DEAREST MOTHER, Yarmouth.

    <p>
      The delirium has subsided. A few minutes ago, as I was kneeling beside
      him, offering up an almost hopeless prayer for his recovery, his eyes
      opened, and I perceived that he knew me. He closed his eyes again without
      speaking, opened them once more, and then looking at me fixedly,
      exclaimed: &ldquo;It is not a dream! You are Leonora!&mdash;<i>my</i> Leonora!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What exquisite pleasure I felt at the sound of these words, at the tone in
      which they were pronounced! My husband folded me in his arms; and, till I
      felt his burning lips, I forgot that he was ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came thoroughly to his recollection, and when the idea that his
      fever might be infectious occurred to him, he endeavoured to prevail upon
      me to leave the room. But what danger can there be for me <i>now</i>? My
      whole soul, my whole frame is inspired with new life. If he recover, your
      daughter may still be happy.

    </h3>
    <p>
      My Dear Madam,
    </p>
    <p>
      A few hours ago my friend became perfectly sensible of his danger, and
      calling me to his bedside, told me that he was eager to make use of the
      little time which he might have to live. He was quite calm and collected.
      He employed me to write his last wishes and bequests; and I must do him
      the justice to declare, that the strongest idea and feeling in his mind
      evidently was the desire to show his entire confidence in his wife, and to
      give her, in his last moments, proofs of his esteem and affection. When he
      had settled his affairs, he begged to be left alone for some time. Between
      twelve and one his bell rang, and he desired to see Lady Leonora and me.
      He spoke to me with that warmth of friendship which he has ever felt from
      our childhood. Then turning to his wife, his voice utterly failed, and he
      could only press to his lips that hand which was held out to him in
      speechless agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent woman!&rdquo; he articulated at last; then collecting his mind, he
      exclaimed, &ldquo;My beloved Leonora, I will not die without expressing my
      feelings for you; I know yours for me. I do not ask for that forgiveness
      which your generous heart granted long before I deserved it. Your
      affection for me has been shown by actions, at the hazard of your life; I
      can only thank you with weak words. You possess my whole heart, my esteem,
      my admiration, my gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Leonora, at the word <i>gratitude</i>, made an effort to speak, and
      laid her hand upon her husband&rsquo;s lips. He added, in a more enthusiastic
      tone, &ldquo;You have my undivided love. Believe in the truth of these words&mdash;perhaps
      they are the last I may ever speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My friend sunk back exhausted, and I carried Lady Leonora out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned half an hour ago, and found every thing silent: Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;
      is lying with his eyes closed&mdash;quite still&mdash;I hope asleep. This
      may be a favourable crisis. I cannot delay this letter longer.

      Excellent news for you to-day!&mdash;Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; is pronounced out
      of danger. He seems excessively touched by my coming here, and so grateful
      for the little kindness I have been able to show him during his illness!

      MY DEAR OLIVIA, Yarmouth.

    <p>
      This is the first line I have written since my illness. I could not sooner
      relieve you from suspense, for during most of this time I have been
      delirious, and never till now able to write. My physicians have this
      morning pronounced me out of danger; and as soon as my strength is
      sufficient to bear the voyage, I shall sail, according to my promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your prudence, or that of your physician, has saved me much anxiety&mdash;perhaps
      saved my life: for had you been so rash as to come hither, besides my
      fears for your safety, I should have been exposed, in the moment of my
      returning reason, to a conflict of passions which I could not have borne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonora is with me; she arrived the night after I was taken ill, and
      forced her way to me, when my fever was at the highest, and while I was in
      a state of delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Leonora will stay with me till the moment I sail, which I expect to
      do in about ten days. I cannot say positively, for I am still very weak,
      and may not be able to keep my word to a day. Adieu. I hope your mind will
      now be at ease. I am glad to hear from the surgeon that your wound is
      quite closed. I will write again, and more fully, when I am better able.
      Believe me, Olivia, I am most anxious to secure your happiness: allow me

      all the ties that bind you to me. You are right: this is what I ought to

    <p>
      Can you believe or imagine that I am actually unwilling to say or to think
      that Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; is quite well? yet this is the fact. Such is the
      inconsistency and weakness of our natures&mdash;of my nature, I should
      say. But a short time ago I thought that no evil could be so great as his
      danger; now that danger is past, I dread to hear him say that he is
      perfectly recovered. The moment he is able he goes to Russia; that is
      decided irrevocably. The promise has been claimed and repeated. A solemn
      promise cannot be broken for any human consideration. I should despise him
      if he broke it; but can I love him for keeping it? His mind is at this
      instant agitated as much as mine is&mdash;more it cannot be. Yet I ought
      to be better able to part with him now than when we parted before, because
      I have now at least the consolation of knowing that he leaves me against
      his will&mdash;that his heart will not go from me. This time I cannot be
      deceived; I have had the most explicit assurances of his <i>undivided</i>
      love. And indeed I was never deceived. All the appearances of regret at
      parting with me were genuine. The general witnessed the consequent
      struggle in Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s mind, and this fever followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will endeavour to calm and content myself with the possession of his
      love, and with the assurance that he will return to me as soon as
      possible. As soon as possible! but what a vague hope! He sails with the
      first fair wind. What a dreadful certainty! Perhaps to-morrow! Oh, my
      dearest mother, perhaps to-night!

    <p>
      MY DEAR MADAM, Yarmouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, finding himself sufficiently recovered, gave
      orders to all his suite to embark, and the wind being fair, determined to
      go on board immediately. In the midst of the bustle of the preparations
      for his departure, Lady Leonora, exhausted by her former activity, and
      unable to take any part in what was passing, sat silent, pale, and
      motionless, opposite to a window, which looked out upon the sea; the
      vessel in which her husband was to sail lay in sight, and her eyes were
      fixed upon the streamers, watching their motion in the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; was in his own apartment writing letters. An express
      arrived; and among other letters for the English ambassador to Russia,
      there was a large packet directed to Lady Leonora L&mdash;&mdash;. Upon
      opening it, the crimson colour flew into her face, and she exclaimed,
      &ldquo;Olivia&rsquo;s letters!&mdash;Lady Olivia&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s letters to Mad. de P&mdash;&mdash;.
      Who could send these to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you joy with all my heart!&rdquo; cried I; &ldquo;no matter how they come&mdash;they
      come in the most fortunate moment possible. I would stake my life upon it
      they will unmask Olivia at once. Where is Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;? He must
      read them this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was hurrying out of the room to call my friend, but Lady Leonora stopped
      my career, and checked the transport of my joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not think, my dear general,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that I would for any
      consideration do so dishonourable an action as to read these letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only let Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; read them,&rdquo; interrupted I, &ldquo;that is all I
      ask of your ladyship. Give them to me. For the soul of me I can see
      nothing dishonourable in this. Let Lady Olivia be judged by her own words.
      Your ladyship shall not be troubled with her trash, but give the letters
      to me, I beseech you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I cannot,&rdquo; said Lady Leonora, steadily. &ldquo;It is a great temptation;
      but I ought not to yield.&rdquo; She deliberately folded them up in a blank
      cover, directed them to Lady Olivia, and sealed them; whilst I, half in
      admiration and half in anger, went on expostulating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! this is being too generous! But, my dear Lady Leonora, why will
      you sacrifice yourself? This is misplaced delicacy! Show those letters,
      and I&rsquo;ll lay my life Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; never goes to Russia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said she, looking up with tears in her eyes, &ldquo;do not
      tempt me beyond my power to resist. Say no more.&rdquo; At this instant Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;came
      into the room; and I am ashamed to confess to your Grace, I really was so
      little master of myself, that I was upon the point of seizing Olivia&rsquo;s
      letters, and putting them into his hands. &ldquo;L&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;here
      is your admirable wife absurdly, yes, I must say it, absurdly standing
      upon a point of honour with one who has none! That packet which she has
      before her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Leonora imposed silence upon me by one of those looks which no man
      can resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Leonora, you are right,&rdquo; said Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;; &ldquo;and you are
      almost right, my dear general: I know what that packet contains; and
      without doing anything dishonourable, I hold myself absolved from my
      promise; I shall not go to Russia, my dearest wife!&rdquo; He flew into her arms&mdash;and
      I left them. I question whether they either of them felt much more than I
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes I was content with knowing that these things had really
      happened, that I had heard Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; say he was absolved from
      all promises, and that he would not go to Russia; but how did all this
      happen so suddenly?&mdash;How did he know the contents of Olivia&rsquo;s
      letters, and without doing any thing dishonourable? There are some people
      who cannot be perfectly happy till they know the <i>rationale</i> of their
      happiness. I am one of these. I did not feel &ldquo;a sober certainty of waking
      bliss,&rdquo; till I read a letter which Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; received by the
      same express that brought Olivia&rsquo;s letters, and which he read while we
      were debating. I beg your Grace&rsquo;s pardon if I am too minute in
      explanation; but I do as I would be done by. The letter was from one of
      the private secretaries, who is, I understand, a relation and friend of
      Lady Leonora L&mdash;&mdash;. As the original goes this night to Lady
      Olivia, I send your Grace a copy. You will give me credit for copying, and

      TO MR. L&mdash;&mdash;

    <p>
      {Private.}
    </p>
    <p>
      London, St. James&rsquo;s-street.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Dear Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same moment you receive this, your lady, for whom I have the
      highest regard, will receive from me a valuable present, a packet of Lady
      Olivia &mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s letters to one of her French friends. These
      letters were lately found in a French frigate, taken by one of our
      cruisers; and, as <i>intercepted correspondence</i> is the order of the
      day, these, with all the despatches on board, were transmitted to our
      office to be examined, in hopes of making reprisals of state secrets. Some
      letters about the court and Emperor of Russia led us to suppose that we
      should find some political manoeuvres, and we examined farther. The
      examination fortunately fell to my lot, as private secretary. After
      looking them all over, however, I found that these papers contain only
      family secrets: I obtained permission to send them to Lady Leonora L&mdash;&mdash;,
      to ensure the triumph of virtue over vice&mdash;to put it into her
      ladyship&rsquo;s power completely to unmask her unworthy rival. These letters
      will show you by what arts you have been deceived. You will find yourself
      ridiculed as <i>a cold, awkward Englishman</i>; one who will <i>hottentot
      again, whatever pains may be taken to civilize him; a man of ice</i>, to
      be taken as a lover from <i>pure charity</i>, or <i>pure curiosity</i>, or
      the pure <i>besoin d&rsquo;aimer</i>. Here are many pure motives, of which you
      will, my dear sir, take your choice. You will farther observe in one of
      her letters, that Lady Olivia premeditated the design of prevailing with
      you to carry her to Russia, that she might show her power <i>to that
      proudest of earthly prudes</i>, the Duchess of &mdash;&mdash;, and that
      she might <i>gratify her great revenge against Lady Leonora L&mdash;&mdash;</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerely hoping, my dear sir, that these letters may open your eyes, and
      restore you and my amiable relation to domestic happiness, I make no
      apology for the liberty I take, and cannot regret the momentary pain I may
      inflict. You are at liberty to make what use you think proper of this
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have it in command from my Lord &mdash;&mdash; to add, that if your
      health, or any other circumstances, should render this embassy to Russia
      less desirable to you than it appeared some time ago, other arrangements
      can be made, and another friend of government is ready to supply your
      place.

    <p>
      My beloved daughter, pride and delight of your happy mother&rsquo;s heart, I
      give you joy! Your temper, fortitude, and persevering affection, have now
      their just reward. Enjoy your happiness, heightened as it must be by the
      sense of self-approbation, and by the sympathy of all who know you. And
      now let me indulge the vanity of a mother; let me exult in the
      accomplishment of my prophecies, and let me be listened to with due
      humility, when I prophesy again. With as much certainty as I foretold what
      is now present, I foresee, my child, your future destiny, and I predict
      that you will preserve while you live your husband&rsquo;s fondest affections.
      Your prudence will prevent you from indulging too far your taste for
      retirement, or for the exclusive society of your intimate friends. Spend
      your winters in London: your rank, your fortune, and, I may be permitted
      to add, your character, manners, and abilities, give you the power of
      drawing round you persons of the best information and of the highest
      talents. Your husband will find, in such society, every thing that can
      attach him to his home; and in you, his most rational friend and his most
      charming companion, who will excite him to every generous and noble
      exertion.

    <p>
      For the good and wise, there is in love, a power unknown to the ignorant
      and the vicious, a power of communicating fresh energy to all the
      faculties of the soul, of exalting them to the highest state of
      perfection. The friendship which in later life succeeds to such love is
      perhaps the greatest, and certainly the most permanent blessing of life.

      LETTER From A GENTLEMAN TO HIS FRIEND,

    <h3>
      BIRTH OF A DAUGHTER;
    </h3>
    <h3>
      WITH THE ANSWER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I congratulate you, my dear sir, upon the birth of your daughter; and I
      wish that some of the fairies of ancient times were at hand to endow the
      damsel with health, wealth, wit, and beauty. Wit?&mdash;I should make a
      long pause before I accepted of this gift for a daughter&mdash;you would
      make none.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I know it to be your opinion that it is in the power of education, more
      certainly than it was ever believed to be in the power of fairies, to
      bestow all mental gifts; and as I have heard you say that education should
      begin as early as possible, I am in haste to offer you my sentiments, lest
      my advice should come too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your general ideas of the habits and virtues essential to the perfection
      of the female character nearly agree with mine; but We differ materially
      as to the cultivation which it is necessary or expedient to bestow upon
      the understandings of women. You are a champion for the rights of woman,
      and insist upon the equality of the sexes: but since the days of chivalry
      are past, and since modern gallantry permits men to speak, at least to one
      another, in less sublime language of the fair; I may confess to you that I
      see neither from experience nor analogy much reason to believe that, in
      the human species alone, there are no marks of inferiority in the female:&mdash;curious
      and admirable exceptions there may be, but many such have not fallen
      within my observation. I cannot say that I have been much enraptured,
      either on a first view or on a closer inspection, with female prodigies.
      Prodigies are scarcely less offensive to my taste than monsters: humanity
      makes us refrain from expressing disgust at the awkward shame of the one,
      whilst the intemperate vanity of the other justly provokes ridicule and
      indignation. I have always observed in the understandings of women who
      have been too much cultivated, some disproportion between the different
      faculties of their minds. One power of the mind undoubtedly may be
      cultivated at the expense of the rest; as we see that one muscle or limb
      may acquire excessive strength, and an unnatural size, at the expense of
      the health of the whole body: I cannot think this desirable, either for
      the individual or for society.&mdash;The unfortunate people in certain
      mountains of Switzerland are, some of them, proud of the excrescence by
      which they are deformed. I have seen women vain of exhibiting mental
      deformities, which to me appeared no less disgusting. In the course of my
      life it has never been my good fortune to meet with a female whose mind,
      in strength, just proportion, and activity, I could compare to that of a
      sensible man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allowing, however, that women are equal to our sex in natural abilities;
      from their situation in society, from their domestic duties, their taste
      for dissipation, their love of romance, poetry, and all the lighter parts
      of literature, their time must be so fully occupied, that they could never
      have leisure for, even supposing that they were capable of, that severe
      application to which our sex submit.&mdash;Between persons of equal genius
      and equal industry, time becomes the only measure of their acquirements.&mdash;Now
      calculate the time which is wasted by the fair sex, and tell me how much
      the start of us they ought to have in the beginning of the race, if they
      are to reach the goal before us?&mdash;It is not possible that women
      should ever be our equals in knowledge, unless you assert that they are
      far our superiors in natural capacity.&mdash;Not only time but,
      opportunity must be wanting to complete female studies:&mdash;we mix with
      the world without restraint, we converse freely with all classes of
      people, with men of wit, of science, of learning, with the artist, the
      mechanic, the labourer; every scene of life is open to our view; every
      assistance that foreign or domestic ingenuity can invent, to encourage
      literary studies, is ours almost exclusively. From academies, colleges,
      public libraries, private associations of literary men, women are
      excluded, if not by law, at least by custom, which cannot easily be
      conquered.&mdash;Whenever women appear, even when we seem to admit them as
      our equals in understanding, every thing assumes a different form; our
      politeness, delicacy, habits towards the sex, forbid us to argue or to
      converse with them as we do with one another:&mdash;we see things as they
      are; but women must always see things through a veil, or cease to be
      women.&mdash;With these insuperable difficulties in their education and in
      their passage through life, it seems impossible that their minds should
      ever acquire that vigour and <i>efficiency</i>, which accurate knowledge
      and various experience of life and manners can bestow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much attention has lately been paid to the education of the female sex;
      and you will say that we have been amply repaid for our care,&mdash;that
      ladies have lately exhibited such brilliant proofs of genius, as must
      dazzle and confound their critics. I do not ask for proofs of genius, I
      ask for solid proofs of utility. In which of the useful arts, in which of
      the exact sciences, have we been assisted by female sagacity or
      penetration?&mdash;I should be glad to see a list of discoveries, of
      inventions, of observations, evincing patient research, of truths
      established upon actual experiment, or deduced by just reasoning from
      previous principles:&mdash;if these, or any of these, can be presented by
      a female champion for her sex, I shall be the first to clear the way for
      her to the temple of Fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must not speak of my contemporaries, else candour might oblige me to
      allow that there are some few instances of great talents applied to useful
      purposes:&mdash;but, except these, what have been the literary productions
      of women! In poetry, plays, romances, in the art of imposing upon the
      understanding by means of the imagination, they have excelled;&mdash;but
      to useful literature they have scarcely turned their thoughts. I have
      never heard of any female proficients in science&mdash;few have pretended
      to science till within these few years.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will tell me, that in the most difficult and most extensive science of
      politics women have succeeded;&mdash;you will cite the names of some
      illustrious queens. I am inclined to think, with the Duke of Burgundy,
      that &ldquo;queens who reigned well were governed by men, and kings who reigned
      ill were governed by women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The isolated examples of a few heroines cannot convince me that it is safe
      or expedient to trust the sex with power:&mdash;their power over
      themselves has regularly been found to diminish, in proportion as their
      power over others has been increased. I should not refer you to the
      scandalous chronicles of modern times, to volumes of private anecdotes, or
      to the abominable secret histories of courts, where female influence and
      female depravity are synonymous terms; but I appeal to the open equitable
      page of history, to a body of evidence collected from the testimony of
      ages, for experiments tried upon the grandest scale of which nature
      admits, registered by various hands, without the possibility of collusion,
      and without a view to any particular system:&mdash;from these you must be
      convinced, that similar consequences have uniformly resulted from the same
      causes, in nations the most unlike, and at periods the most distant. Trace
      the history of female nature, from the court of Augustus to the court of
      Louis the Fourteenth, and tell me whether you can hesitate to acknowledge
      that the influence, the liberty, and the <i>power</i> of women have been
      constant concomitants of the moral and political decline of empires;&mdash;I
      say the concomitants: where events are thus invariably connected, I might
      be justified in saying that they were <i>causes</i>&mdash;you would call
      them <i>effects</i>; but we need not dispute about the momentary
      precedence of evils, which are found to be inseparable companions:&mdash;they
      may be alternately cause and effect,&mdash;the reality of the connexion is
      established; it may be difficult to ascertain precisely its nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will assert, that the fatal consequences which have resulted from our
      trusting the sex with liberty and power, have been originally occasioned
      by the subjection and ignorance in which they had previously been held,
      and of our subsequent folly and imprudence, in <i>throwing the reins of
      dominion into hands unprepared and uneducated to guide them</i>. I am at a
      loss to conceive any system of education that can properly prepare women
      for the exercise of power. Cultivate their understandings, &ldquo;cleanse the
      visual orb with euphrasy and rue,&rdquo; till they can with one comprehensive
      glance take in &ldquo;one half at least of round eternity;&rdquo; still you have no
      security that their reason will govern their conduct. The moral character
      seems, even amongst men of superior strength of mind, to have no certain
      dependence upon the reasoning faculty;&mdash;habit, prejudice, taste,
      example, and the different strength of various passions, form the moral
      character. We are impelled to action, frequently contrary to the belief of
      our sober reason; and we pursue what we could, in the hour of
      deliberation, demonstrate to be inconsistent with <i>that greatest
      possible share of happiness</i>, which it is the object of every rational
      creature to secure. We frequently &ldquo;think with one species of enthusiasm,
      and act with another:&rdquo; and can we expect from women more consistency of
      conduct, if they are allowed the same liberty?&mdash;No one can feel, more
      strongly than you do, the necessity and the value of female integrity; no
      one can more clearly perceive how much in society depends upon the honour
      of women; and how much it is the interest of every individual, as well as
      of every state, to guard their virtue, and to preserve inviolate the
      purity of their manners. Allow me, then, to warn you of the danger of
      talking in loud strains to the sex, of the noble contempt of prejudice.
      You would look with horror at one who should go to sap the foundations of
      the building; beware then how you venture to tear away the ivy which
      clings to the walls, and braces the loose stones together.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am by no means disposed to indulge in the fashionable ridicule of
      prejudice. There is a sentimental, metaphysical argument, which,
      independently of all others, has lately been used, to prevail upon us to
      relinquish that superiority which strength of body in savage, and strength
      of mind in civilized nations, secure to man. We are told, that as women
      are reasonable creatures, they should be governed only by reason; and that
      we <i>disgrace</i> ourselves, and <i>enslave</i> them, when we instil even
      the most useful truths as prejudices.&mdash;Morality should, we are told,
      be founded upon demonstration, not upon sentiment; and we should not
      require human beings to submit to any laws or customs, without convincing
      their understandings of the universal utility of these political
      conventions. When are we to expect this conviction? We cannot expect it
      from childhood, scarcely from youth; but from the maturity of the
      understanding we are told that we may expect it with certainty.&mdash;And
      of what use can it then be to us? When the habits are fixed, when the
      character is decided, when the manners are formed, what can be done by the
      bare conviction of the understanding? What could we expect from that
      woman, whose moral education was to begin, at the moment when she was
      called upon to <i>act</i>; and who, without having imbibed in her early
      years any of the salutary prejudices of her sex, or without having been
      educated in the amiable acquiescence to well established maxims of female
      prudence, should boldly venture to conduct herself by the immediate
      conviction of her understanding? I care not for the names or titles of my
      guides; all that I shall inquire is, which is best acquainted with the
      road. Provided women be conducted quietly to their good, it is scarcely
      worth their while to dispute about the pompous metaphysical names, or
      precedency of their motives. Why should they deem it disgraceful to be
      induced to pursue their interest by what some philosophers are pleased to
      call <i>weak</i> motives? Is it not much less disgraceful to be peaceably
      governed by weak reasons, than to be incapable of being restrained by the
      strongest? The dignity of human nature, and the boasted free-will of
      rational agents, are high-sounding words, likely to impose upon the vanity
      of the fair sex, as well as upon the pride of ours; but if we analyze the
      ideas annexed to these terms, to what shall we reduce them? Reason in its
      highest perfection seems just to arrive at the certainty of instinct; and
      truth impressed upon the mind in early youth by the united voice of
      affection and authority, gives all the real advantages of the most
      investigating spirit of philosophy. If the result of the thought,
      experience, and sufferings of one race of beings is, (when inculcated upon
      the belief of the next,) to be stigmatized as prejudice, there is an end
      to all the benefits of history and of education. The mutual intercourse of
      individuals and of nations must be only for the traffic or amusement of
      the day. Every age must repeat the same experiments; every man and every
      nation must make the same mistakes, and suffer the same miseries, whilst
      the civilization and happiness of the world, if not retrograde in their
      course, must, for ever be stationary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us not then despise, or teach the other sex to despise, the
      traditional maxims of experience, or those early prepossessions, which may
      be termed prejudices, but which in reality serve as their moral instinct.
      I can see neither tyranny on our part, nor slavery on theirs, in this
      system of education. This sentimental or metaphysical appeal to our
      candour and generosity has then no real force; and every other argument
      for the <i>literary</i> and <i>philosophical</i> education of women, and
      for the extraordinary cultivation of their understandings, I have
      examined.
    </p>
    <p>
      You probably imagine that, by the superior ingenuity and care you may
      bestow on your daughter&rsquo;s education, you shall make her an exception to
      general maxims; you shall give her all the blessings of a literary
      cultivation, and at the same time preserve her from all the follies, and
      faults, and evils, which have been found to attend the character of a
      literary lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Systems produce projects; and as projects in education are of all others
      the most hazardous, they should not be followed till after the most mature
      deliberation. Though it may be natural, is it wise for any man to expect
      extraordinary success, from his efforts or his precautions, beyond what
      has ever been the share of those who have had motives as strong for care
      and for exertion, and some of whom were possibly his equals in ability? Is
      it not incumbent upon you, as a parent and as a philosopher, to calculate
      accurately what you have to fear, as well as what you have to hope? You
      can at present, with a sober degree or interest, bear to hear me enumerate
      the evils, and ridicule the foibles, incident to literary ladies; but if
      your daughter were actually in this class, you would not think it friendly
      if I were to attack them. In this favourable moment, then, I beg you to
      hear me with temper; and as I touch upon every danger and every fault,
      consider cautiously whether you have a certain preventive or a specific
      remedy in store for each of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women of literature are much more numerous of late than they were a few
      years ago. They make a class in society, they fill the public eye, and
      have acquired a degree of consequence and an appropriate character. The
      esteem of private friends, and the admiration of the public for their
      talents, are circumstances highly flattering to their vanity; and as such
      I will allow them to be substantial pleasures. I am also ready to
      acknowledge that a taste for literature adds much to the happiness of
      life, and that women may enjoy to a certain degree this happiness as well
      as men. But with literary women this silent happiness seems at best but a
      subordinate consideration; it is not by the treasures they possess, but by
      those which they have an opportunity of displaying, that they estimate
      their wealth. To obtain public applause, they are betrayed too often into
      a miserable ostentation of their learning. Coxe tells us, that certain
      Russian ladies split their pearls, in order to make a greater display of
      finery.

      The pleasure of being admired for wit or erudition, I cannot exactly
      measure in a female mind; but state it to be as delightful as you can
      imagine it to be, there are evils attendant upon it, which, in the
      estimation of a prudent father, may over-balance the good. The
      intoxicating effect of wit upon the brain has been well remarked, by a
      poet, who was a friend to the fair sex: and too many ridiculous, and too
      many disgusting examples confirm the truth of the observation. The
      deference that is paid to genius, sometimes makes the fair sex forget that
      genius will be respected only when united with discretion. Those who have
      acquired fame, fancy that they can afford to sacrifice reputation. I will
      suppose, however, that their heads shall be strong enough to bear
      inebriating admiration, and that their conduct shall be essentially
      irreproachable; yet they will show in their manners and conversation that
      contempt of inferior minds, and that neglect of common forms and customs,
      which will provoke the indignation of fools, and which cannot escape the
      censure of the wise. Even whilst we are secure of their innocence, we
      dislike that daring spirit in the female sex, which delights to oppose the
      common opinions of society, and from apparent trifles we draw unfavourable
      omens, which experience too often confirms. You will ask me why I should
      suppose that wits are more liable to be spoiled by admiration than
      beauties, who have usually a larger share of it, and who are not more
      exempt from vanity? Those who are vain of trifling accomplishments, of
      rank, of riches, or of beauty, depend upon the world for their immediate
      gratification. They are sensible of their dependence; they listen with
      deference to the maxims, and attend with anxiety to the opinions of those,
      from whom they expect their reward and their daily amusements. In their
      subjection consists their safety; whilst women, who neither feel dependent
      for amusement nor for self-approbation upon company and public places, are
      apt to consider this subjection as humiliating, if not insupportable:
      perceiving their own superiority, they despise, and even set at defiance,
      the opinions of their acquaintance of inferior abilities: contempt, where
      it cannot be openly retorted, produces aversion, not the less to be
      dreaded because constrained to silence: envy, considered as the
      involuntary tribute extorted by merit, is flattering to pride: and I know
      that many women delight to excite envy, even whilst they affect to fear
      its consequences: but they, who imprudently provoke it, are little aware
      of the torments they prepare for themselves.&mdash;&ldquo;Cover your face well
      before you disturb the hornet&rsquo;s nest,&rdquo; was a maxim of the <i>experienced</i>
      Catherine de Medici.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men of literature, if we may trust to the bitter expressions of anguish in
      their writings, and in their private letters, feel acutely all the stings
      of envy. Women, who have more susceptibility of temper, and less strength
      of mind, and who, from the delicate nature of their reputation, are more
      exposed to attack, are also less able to endure it. Malignant critics,
      when they cannot attack an author&rsquo;s peace in his writings, frequently
      scrutinize his private life; and every personal anecdote is published
      without regard to truth or propriety. How will the delicacy of the female
      character endure this treatment? How will her friends bear to see her
      pursued even in domestic retirement, if she should be wise enough to make
      that retirement her choice? How will they like to see premature memoirs,
      and spurious collections of familiar letters, published by needy
      booksellers, or designing enemies? Yet to all these things men of letters
      are subject; and such must literary ladies expect, if they attain to any
      degree of eminence.&mdash;Judging, then, from the experience of our sex, I
      may pronounce envy to be one of the evils which women of uncommon genius
      have to dread. &ldquo;Censure,&rdquo; says a celebrated writer, &ldquo;is a tax which every
      man must pay to the public, who seeks to be eminent.&rdquo; Women must expect to
      pay it doubly.

      Your daughter, perhaps, shall be above scandal. She shall despise the idle
      whisper, and the common tattle of her sex; her soul shall be raised above
      the ignorant and the frivolous; she shall have a relish for higher
      conversation, and a taste for higher society; but where is she to find, or
      how is she to obtain this society? You make her incapable of friendship
      with her own sex. Where is she to look for friends, for companions, for
      equals? Amongst men? Amongst what class of men? Not amongst men of
      business, or men of gallantry, but amongst men of literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learned men have usually chosen for their wives, or for their companions,
      women who were rather below than above the standard of mediocrity: this
      seems to me natural and reasonable. Such men, probably, feel their own
      incapacity for the daily business of life, their ignorance of the world,
      their slovenly habits, and neglect of domestic affairs. They do not want
      wives who have precisely their own defects; they rather desire to find
      such as shall, by the opposite habits and virtues, supply their
      deficiencies. I do not see why two books should marry, any more than two
      estates. Some few exceptions might be quoted against Stewart&rsquo;s
      observations. I have just seen, under the article &ldquo;A Literary Wife,&rdquo; in
      D&rsquo;Israeli&rsquo;s Curiosities of Literature, an account of Francis Phidelphus, a
      great scholar in the fifteenth century, who was so desirous of acquiring
      the Greek language in perfection, that he travelled to Constantinople in
      search of a <i>Grecian wife</i>: the lady proved a scold. &ldquo;But to do
      justice to the name of Theodora,&rdquo; as this author adds, &ldquo;she has been
      honourably mentioned in the French Academy of Sciences.&rdquo; I hope this
      proved an adequate compensation to her husband for his domestic broils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy Mad. Dacier! you found a husband suited to your taste! You and Mons.
      Dacier, if D&rsquo;Alembert tells the story rightly, once cooked a dish in
      concert, by a receipt which you found in Apicius, and you both sat down
      and ate of your learned ragout till you were both like to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were I sure, my dear friend, that every literary lady would be equally
      fortunate in finding in a husband a man who would sympathize in her
      tastes, I should diminish my formidable catalogue of evils. But, alas! M.
      Dacier is no more; &ldquo;and we shall never live to see his fellow.&rdquo; Literary
      ladies will, I am afraid, be losers in love, as well as in friendship, by
      the superiority.&mdash;Cupid is a timid, playful child, and is frightened
      at the helmet of Minerva. It has been observed, that gentlemen are not apt
      to admire a prodigious quantity of learning and masculine acquirements in
      the fair sex;&mdash;we usually consider a certain degree of weakness, both
      of mind and body, as friendly to female grace. I am not absolutely of this
      opinion; yet I do not see the advantage of supernatural force, either of
      body or mind, to female excellence. Hercules-Spinster found his strength
      rather an incumbrance than an advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Superiority of mind must be united with great temper and generosity, to be
      tolerated by those who are forced to submit to its influence. I have seen
      witty and learned ladies, who did not seem to think it at all incumbent
      upon them to sacrifice any thing to the sense of propriety. On the
      contrary, they seemed to take both pride and pleasure in showing the
      utmost stretch of their strength, regardless of the consequences, panting
      only for victory. Upon such occasions, when the adversary has been a
      husband or a father, I must acknowledge that I have felt sensations which
      few ladies can easily believe they excite. Airs and graces I can bear as
      well as another; but airs without graces no man thinks himself bound to
      bear, and learned airs least of all. Ladies of high rank in the court of
      Parnassus are apt, sometimes, to claim precedency out of their own
      dominions, which creates much confusion, and generally ends in their being
      affronted. That knowledge of the world which keeps people in their proper
      places they will never learn from the Muses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molière has pointed out, with all the force of comic ridicule, in the
      Femmes Savantes, that a lady, who aspires to the sublime delights of
      philosophy and poetry, must forego the simple pleasures, and will despise
      the duties of domestic life. I should not expect that my house affairs
      would be with haste despatched by a Desdemona, weeping over some
      unvarnished tale, or petrified with some history of horrors, at the very
      time when she should be ordering dinner, or paying the butcher&rsquo;s bill.&mdash;I
      should have the less hope of rousing her attention to my culinary concerns
      and domestic grievances, because I should probably incur her contempt for
      hinting at these sublunary matters, and her indignation for supposing that
      she ought to be employed in such degrading occupations. I have heard, that
      if these sublime geniuses are awakened from their reveries by the <i>appulse</i>
      of external circumstances, they start, and exhibit all the perturbation
      and amazement of <i>cataleptic</i> patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Charles Harrington, in the days of Queen Elizabeth, addressed a copy
      of verses to his wife, &ldquo;On Women&rsquo;s Vertues:&rdquo;&mdash;these he divides into
      &ldquo;the private, <i>civill</i>, and heroyke;&rdquo; the private belong to the
      country housewife, whom it concerned; chiefly&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;The fruit, malt, hops, to tend, to dry, to utter,
    To beat, strip, spin the wool, the hemp, the flax,
    Breed poultry, gather honey, try the wax,
  And more than all, to have good cheese and butter.
  Then next a step, but yet a large step higher,
    Came civill vertue fitter for the citty,
  With modest looks, good clothes, and answers witty.
  These baser things not done, but guided by her.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      As for heroyke vertue, and heroyke dames, honest Sir Charles would have
      nothing to do with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allowing, however, that you could combine all these virtues&mdash;that you
      could form a perfect whole, a female wonder from every creature&rsquo;s best&mdash;dangers
      still threaten you. How will you preserve your daughter from that desire
      of universal admiration, which will ruin all your work? How will you,
      along with all the pride of knowledge, give her that &ldquo;retiring modesty,&rdquo;
       which is supposed to have more charms for our sex than the fullest display
      of wit and beauty?
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>fair Pauca of Thoulouse</i> was so called because she was so fair
      that no one could live either with or without beholding her:&mdash;whenever
      she came forth from her own mansion, which, history observes, she did very
      seldom, such impetuous crowds rushed to obtain a sight of her, that limbs
      were broken and lives were lost wherever she appeared. She ventured abroad
      less frequently&mdash;the evil increased&mdash;till at length the
      magistrates of the city issued an edict commanding the fair Pauca, under
      the pain of perpetual imprisonment, to appear in broad daylight for one
      hour, every week, in the public market-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern ladies, by frequenting public places so regularly, declare their
      approbation of the wholesome regulations of these prudent magistrates.
      Very different was the crafty policy of the prophet Mahomet, who forbad
      his worshippers even to paint his picture. The Turks have pictures of the
      hand, the foot, the features of Mahomet, but no representation of the
      whole face or person is allowed. The portraits of our beauties, in our
      exhibition-room, show a proper contempt of this insidious policy; and
      those learned and ingenious ladies who publish their private letters,
      select maxims, secret anecdotes, and family memoirs, are entitled to our
      thanks, for thus presenting us with full-lengths of their minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you expect, my dear sir, that your daughter, with all the genius and
      learning which you intend to give her, should refrain from these imprudent
      exhibitions? Will she &ldquo;yield her charms of mind with sweet delay?&rdquo; Will
      she, in every moment of her life, recollect that the fatal desire for
      universal applause always defeats its own purpose, especially if the
      purpose be to win our love as well as our admiration? It is in vain to
      tell me, that more enlarged ideas in our sex would alter our tastes, and
      alter even the associations which now influence our passions. The captive
      who has numbered the links of his chains, and has even discovered how
      these chains are constructed, is not therefore nearer to the recovery of
      his liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, it must take a length of time to alter associations and opinions,
      which, if not <i>just</i>, are at least <i>common</i> in our sex. You
      cannot expect even that conviction should operate immediately upon the
      public taste. You will, in a few years, have educated your daughter; and
      if the world be not educated exactly at the right time to judge of her
      perfections, to admire and love them, you will have wasted your labour,
      and you will have sacrificed your daughter&rsquo;s happiness: that happiness,
      analyze it as a man of the world or as a philosopher, must depend on
      friendship, love, the exercise of her virtues, the just performance of all
      the duties of life, and the self-approbation arising from the
      consciousness of good conduct.

      ANSWER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      TO
    </h3>
    <h3>
      THE PRECEDING LETTER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have as little taste for Mad. Dacier&rsquo;s learned ragout as you can have,
      my dear sir; and I pity the great scholar, who travelled to Constantinople
      for the termagant Theodora, believing, as you do, that the honourable
      mention made of her by the French Academy of Sciences, could be no
      adequate compensation to her husband for domestic disquiet: but the lady&rsquo;s
      learning was not essential to his misfortune; he might have met with a
      scolding dame, though he had not married a Grecian. A profusion of vulgar
      aphorisms in the dialects of all the counties in England, proverbs in
      Welsh, Scotish, French, Spanish, Italian, and Hebrew, might be adduced to
      prove that scolds are to be found amongst all classes of women. I am,
      however, willing to allow, that the more learning, and wit, and eloquence
      a lady possesses, the more troublesome and the more dangerous she may
      become as a wife or daughter, unless she is also possessed of good sense
      and good temper. Of your honest Sir Charles Harrington&rsquo;s two pattern
      wives, I think I should prefer the country housewife, with whom I could be
      sure of having good cheese and butter, to the <i>citty dame</i> with her
      good clothes and answers witty.&mdash;I should be afraid that these
      answers witty might be turned against me, and might prove the torment of
      my life.&mdash;You, who have attended to female disputants, must have
      remarked, that, learned or unlearned, they seldom know how to reason; they
      assert and declaim, employ wit, and eloquence, and sophistry, to confute,
      persuade, or abash their adversaries; but distinct reasoning they neither
      use nor comprehend.&mdash;Till women learn to reason, it is in vain that
      they acquire learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are satisfied, I am sure, with this acknowledgment. I will go farther,
      and at once give up to you all the learned ladies that exist, or that ever
      have existed: but when I use the term literary ladies, I mean women who
      have cultivated their understandings not for the purposes of parade, but
      with the desire to make themselves useful and agreeable. I estimate the
      value of a woman&rsquo;s abilities and acquirements, by the degree in which they
      contribute to her happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      You think yourself happy because you are wise, said a philosopher to a
      pedant.&mdash;I think myself wise because I am happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      You tell me, that even supposing I could educate my daughter so as to
      raise her above the common faults and follies of her sex; even supposing I
      could give her an enlarged understanding, and literature free from
      pedantry, she would be in danger of becoming unhappy, because she would
      not, amongst her own sex, find friends suited to her taste, nor amongst
      ours, admirers adequate to her expectations: you represent her as in the
      situation of the poor flying-fish, exposed to dangerous enemies in her own
      element, yet certain, if she tries to soar above them, of being pounced
      upon by the hawk-eyed critics of the higher regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      You allow, however, that women of literature are much more numerous of
      late than they were a few years ago; that they make a class in society,
      and have acquired a considerable degree of consequence, and an appropriate
      character; how can you then fear that a woman of cultivated understanding
      should be driven from the society of her own sex in search of dangerous
      companions amongst ours? In the female world she will be neither without
      an equal nor without a judge; she will not have much to fear from envy,
      because its malignant eye will not fix upon one object exclusively, when
      there are numbers to distract its attention, and share the stroke. The
      fragile nature of female friendships, the petty jealousies which break out
      at the ball or in the drawing-room, have been from time immemorial the
      jest of mankind. Trifles, light as air, will necessarily excite not only
      the jealousy, but the envy of those who think only of trifles. Give them
      more employment for their thoughts, give them a nobler spirit of
      emulation, and we shall hear no more of these paltry feuds; give them more
      useful and more interesting subjects of conversation, and they become not
      only more agreeable, but safer companions for each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unmarried women, who have stored their minds with knowledge, who have
      various tastes and literary occupations, who can amuse and be amused in
      the conversation of well-informed people, are in no danger of becoming
      burthensome to their friends or to society: though they may not be seen
      haunting every place of amusement or of public resort, they are not
      isolated or forlorn; by a variety of associations they are connected with
      the world, and their sympathy is expanded and supported by the cultivation
      of their understandings; nor can it sink, settle, and concentrate upon
      cats, parrots, and monkeys. How far the human heart may be contracted by
      ignorance it is difficult to determine; but I am little inclined to envy
      the <i>simple</i> pleasures of those whose understandings are totally
      uncultivated.&mdash;Sir William Hamilton, in his account of the last
      eruption of Mount Vesuvius, gives us a curious picture of the excessive
      ignorance and stupidity of some nuns in a convent at Torre del Greco:&mdash;one
      of these nuns was found warming herself at the red-hot lava, which had
      rolled up to the window of her cell. It was with the greatest difficulty
      that these scarcely rational beings could be made to comprehend the nature
      of their danger; and when at last they were prevailed upon to quit the
      convent, and were advised to carry with them whatever they thought most
      valuable, they loaded themselves with sweetmeats.&mdash;Those who wish for
      ignorant wives, may find them in other parts of the world, as well as in
      Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not pretend, that even by cultivating my daughter&rsquo;s understanding I
      can secure for her a husband suited to her taste; it will therefore be
      prudent to make her felicity in some degree independent of matrimony. Many
      parents have sufficient kindness and foresight to provide, in point of
      fortune, for their daughters; but few consider that if a single life
      should be their choice or their doom, something more is necessary to
      secure respect and happiness for them in the decline of life. The silent
      <i>unreproved</i> pleasures of literature are the sure resource of those
      who have cultivated minds; those who have not, must wear out their
      disconsolate unoccupied old age as chance directs. When you say that men
      of superior understanding dislike the appearance of extraordinary strength
      of mind in the fair sex, you probably mean that the display of that
      strength is disgusting, and you associate with the idea of strength of
      mind, masculine, arrogant, or pedantic manners: but there is no necessary
      connexion between these things; and it seems probable that the faults
      usually ascribed to learned ladies, like those peculiar to learned men,
      may have arisen in a great measure from circumstances which the progress
      of civilization in society has much altered.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the times of ignorance, men of deep science were considered by the
      vulgar as a class of necromancers, and they were looked upon alternately
      with terror and admiration; and learned men imposed upon the vulgar by
      assuming strange airs of mystery and self-importance, wore long beards and
      solemn looks; they spoke and wrote in a phraseology peculiar to
      themselves, and affected to consider the rest of mankind as beneath their
      notice: but since knowledge has been generally diffused, all this
      affectation has been laid aside; and though we now and then hear of men of
      genius who indulge themselves in peculiarities, yet upon the whole the
      manners of literary men are not strikingly nor wilfully different from
      those of the rest of the world. The peculiarities of literary women will
      also disappear as their numbers increase. You are disgusted by their
      ostentation of learning. Have patience with them, my dear sir; their taste
      will become more simple when they have been taught by experience that this
      parade is offensive: even the bitter expression of your disgust may be
      advantageous to those whose manners are yet to be formed; they will at
      least learn from it what to avoid; and your letter may perhaps hereafter
      be of service in my daughter&rsquo;s education.&mdash;It is scarcely to be
      supposed, that a girl of good understanding would deliberately imitate the
      faults and follies which she hears ridiculed during her childhood, by
      those whom she esteems.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to your dread of prodigies, that will subside:&mdash;prodigies are
      heard of most frequently during the ages of ignorance. A woman may now
      possess a considerable stock of information without being gazed upon as a
      miracle of learning; and there is not much danger of her being vain of
      accomplishments which cease to be astonishing. Nor will her peace be
      disturbed by the idle remarks of the ignorant vulgar.&mdash;A literary
      lady is no longer a sight; the spectacle is now too common to attract
      curiosity; the species of animal is too well known even to admit of much
      exaggeration in the description of its appearance, A lady riding on
      horseback upon a side-saddle is not thought a wonderful thing by the
      common people in England; but when an English lady rode upon a side-saddle
      in an Italian city, where the sight was unusual, she was universally gazed
      at by the populace; to some she appeared an object of astonishment, to
      others of compassion:&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! poverina,&rdquo; they exclaimed, &ldquo;n&rsquo;ha che una
      gamba!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same objects excite different emotions in different situations; and to
      judge what will astonish or delight any given set of people some years
      hence, we must consider not merely what is the fashion of to-day, but
      whither the current of opinion runs, and what is likely to be the fashion
      of hereafter.&mdash;You must have observed that public opinion is at
      present more favourable to the cultivation of the understanding of the
      female sex than it was some years ago; more attention is paid to the
      education of women, more knowledge and literature are expected from them
      in society. From the literary lady of the present day something more is
      expected than that she should know how to spell and to write better than
      Swift&rsquo;s celebrated Stella, whom he reproves for writing <i>villian</i> and
      <i>daenger</i>:&mdash;perhaps this very Stella was an object of envy in
      her own day to those who were her inferiors in literature. No man wishes
      his wife to be obviously less cultivated than those of her own rank; and
      something more is now required, even from ordinary talents, than what
      distinguished the accomplished lady of the seventeenth century. What the
      standard of excellence may be in the next age we cannot ascertain, but we
      may guess that the taste for literature will continue to be progressive;
      therefore, even if you assume that the education of the female sex should
      be guided by the taste and reigning opinions of ours, and that it should
      be the object of their lives to win and keep our hearts, you must admit
      the expediency of attending to that fashionable demand for literature and
      the fine arts, which has arisen in society.
    </p>
    <p>
      No woman can foresee what may be the taste of the man with whom she may be
      united; much of her happiness, however, will depend upon her being able to
      conform her taste to his: for this reason I should therefore, in female
      education, cultivate the general powers of the mind, rather than any
      particular faculty. I do not desire to make my daughter merely a musician,
      a painter, or a poet; I do not desire to make her merely a botanist, a
      mathematician, or a chemist; but I wish to give her early the habit of
      industry and attention, the love of knowledge, and the power of reasoning:
      these will enable her to attend to excellence in any pursuit to which she
      may direct her talents. You will observe, that many things which formerly
      were thought above the comprehension of women, or unfit for their sex, are
      now acknowledged to be perfectly within the compass of their abilities,
      and suited to their situation.&mdash;Formerly the fair sex was kept in
      Turkish ignorance; every means of acquiring knowledge was discountenanced
      by fashion, and impracticable even to those who despised fashion;&mdash;our
      books of science were full of unintelligible jargon, and mystery veiled
      pompous ignorance from public contempt; but now writers must offer their
      discoveries to the public in distinct terms, which every body may
      understand; technical language no longer supplies the place of knowledge,
      and the art of teaching has been carried to such perfection, that a degree
      of knowledge may now with ease be acquired in the course of a few years,
      which formerly it was the business of a life to attain. All this is much
      in favour of female literature. Ladies have become ambitious to
      superintend the education of their children, and hence they have been
      induced to instruct themselves, that they may be able to direct and inform
      their pupils. The mother, who now aspires to be the esteemed and beloved
      instructress of her children, must have a considerable portion of
      knowledge. Science has of late &ldquo;<i>been enlisted under the banners of
      imagination</i>,&rdquo; by the irresistible charms of genius; by the same power,
      her votaries will be led &ldquo;<i>from the looser analogies which dress out the
      imagery of poetry to the stricter ones which form the ratiocination of
      philosophy</i>{1}.&rdquo;&mdash;Botany has become fashionable; in time it may
      become useful, if it be not so already. Chemistry will follow botany.
      Chemistry is a science well suited to the talents and situation of women;
      it is not a science of parade; it affords occupation and infinite variety;
      it demands no bodily strength; it can be pursued in retirement; it applies
      immediately to useful and domestic purposes; and whilst the ingenuity of
      the most inventive mind may in this science be exercised, there is no
      danger of inflaming the imagination, because the mind is intent upon
      realities, the knowledge that is acquired is exact, and the pleasure of
      the pursuit is a sufficient reward for the labour.

      A clear and ready knowledge of arithmetic is surely no useless acquirement
      for those who are to regulate the expenses of a family. Economy is not the
      mean &ldquo;penny wise and pound foolish&rdquo; policy which some suppose it to be; it
      is the art of calculation joined to the habit of order, and the power of
      proportioning our wishes to the means of gratifying them. The little
      pilfering temper of a wife is despicable and odious to every man of sense;
      but there is a judicious, graceful species of economy, which has no
      connexion with an avaricious temper, and which, as it depends upon the
      understanding, can be expected only from cultivated minds. Women who have
      been well educated, far from despising domestic duties, will hold them in
      high respect; because they will see that the whole happiness of life is
      made up of the happiness of each particular day and hour, and that much of
      the enjoyment of these must depend upon the punctual practice of those
      virtues which are more valuable than splendid.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not, I hope, your opinion, that ignorance is the best security for
      female virtue. If this connexion between virtue and ignorance could once
      be clearly proved, we ought to drown our books deeper than ever plummet
      sounded:&mdash;I say <i>we</i>&mdash;for the danger extends equally to
      both sexes, unless you assert that the duties of men rest upon a more
      certain foundation than the duties of the other sex: if our virtues can be
      demonstrated to be advantageous, why should theirs suffer for being
      exposed to the light of reason?&mdash;All social virtue conduces to our
      own happiness or that of our fellow-creatures; can it weaken the sense of
      duty to illustrate this truth?&mdash;Having once pointed out to the
      understanding of a sensible woman the necessary connexion between her
      virtues and her happiness, must not those virtues, and the means of
      preserving them, become in her eyes objects of the most interesting
      importance? But you fear, that even if their conduct continued to be
      irreproachable, the manners of women might be rendered less delicate by
      the increase of their knowledge; you dislike in the female sex that daring
      spirit which despises the common forms of society, and which breaks
      through the reserve and delicacy of female manners:&mdash;so do I:&mdash;and
      the best method to make my pupil respect these things is to show her how
      they are indispensably connected with the largest interests of society:
      surely this perception of the utility of forms apparently trifling, must
      be a strong security to the prudential reserve of the sex, and far
      superior to the automatic habits of those who submit to the conventions of
      the world without consideration or conviction. Habit, confirmed by reason,
      assumes the rank of virtue. The motives that restrain from vice must be
      increased by the clear conviction, that vice and wretchedness are
      inseparably united.
    </p>

      Do not, however, imagine, my dear sir, that I shall attempt to lay moral
      demonstration before <i>a child</i>, who could not possibly comprehend my
      meaning; do not imagine that because I intend to cultivate my daughter&rsquo;s
      understanding, I shall neglect to give her those early habits of reserve
      and modesty which constitute the female character.&mdash;Believing, as I
      do, that woman, as well as man, may be called a bundle of habits, I shall
      be peculiarly careful, during my child&rsquo;s early education, to give her as
      many good habits as possible; by degrees as her understanding, that is to
      say as her knowledge and power of reasoning shall increase, I can explain
      the advantages of these habits, and confirm their power by the voice of
      reason. I lose no time, I expose myself to no danger, by this system. On
      the contrary, those who depend entirely upon the force of custom and
      prejudice expose themselves to infinite danger. If once their pupils begin
      to reflect upon their own hoodwinked education, they will probably suspect
      that they have been deceived in all that they have been taught, and they
      will burst their bonds with indignation.&mdash;Credulity is always rash in
      the moment she detects the impositions that have been practised upon her
      easy temper. In this inquiring age, few have any chance of passing through
      life without being excited to examine the motives and principles from
      which they act: is it not therefore prudent to cultivate the reasoning
      faculty, by which alone this examination can be made with safety? A false
      argument, a repartee, the charms of wit or eloquence, the voice of
      fashion, of folly, of numbers, might, if she had no substantial reasons to
      support her cause, put virtue not only out of countenance, but out of
      humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      You speak of moral instinct. As far as I understand the term, it implies
      certain habits early acquired from education; to these I would add the
      power of reasoning, and then, and not till then, I should think myself
      safe:&mdash;for I have observed that the pupils of habit are utterly
      confounded when they are placed in circumstances different from those to
      which they have been accustomed.&mdash;It has been remarked by travellers
      and naturalists, that animals, notwithstanding their boasted instinctive
      knowledge, sometimes make strange and fatal mistakes in their conduct,
      when they are placed in new situations:&mdash;destitute of the reasoning
      faculty, and deceived by resemblances, they mistake poison for food. Thus
      the bull-frog will swallow burning charcoal, mistaking it for fire-flies;
      and the European hogs and poultry which travelled to Surinam poisoned
      themselves by eating plants that were unknown to them{1}.

      You seem, my dear sir, to be afraid that truth should not keep so firm a
      hold upon the mind as prejudice; and you produce an allusion to justify
      your fears. You tell us that civil society is like a building, and you
      warn me not to tear down the ivy which clings to the walls, and braces the
      loose stones together.&mdash;I believe that ivy, in some situations, tends
      to pull down the walls to which it clings.&mdash;You think it is not worth
      while to cultivate the understandings of women, because you say that you
      have no security that the conviction of their reason will have any
      permanent good effect upon their conduct; and to persuade me of this, you
      bid me observe that men who are superior to women in strength of mind and
      judgment, are frequently misled by their passions. By this mode of
      argument, you may conclude that reason is totally useless to the whole
      human race; but you cannot, with any show of justice, infer that it ought
      to be monopolized by one-half of mankind. But why should you quarrel with
      reason, because passion sometimes conquers her?&mdash;You should endeavour
      to strengthen the connexion between theory and practice, if it be not
      sufficiently strong already; but you can gain nothing by destroying
      theory.&mdash;Happiness is your aim; but your unpractised or unsteady hand
      does not obey your will: you do not at the first trial hit the mark
      precisely.&mdash;Would you, because you are awkward, insist upon being
      blind?
    </p>
    <p>
      The strength of mind which enables people to govern themselves by their
      reason, is not always connected with abilities even in their most
      cultivated state: I deplore the instances which I have seen of this truth,
      but I do not despair; on the contrary, I am excited to inquire into the
      causes of this phenomenon; nor, because I see some evil, would I sacrifice
      the good upon a bare motive of suspicion. It is a contradiction to say,
      that giving the power to discern what is good is giving a disposition to
      prefer what is bad. I acknowledge with regret, that women who have been
      but half instructed, who have seen only superficially the relations of
      moral and political ideas, and who have obtained but an imperfect
      knowledge of the human heart, have conducted themselves so as to disgrace
      their talents and their sex; these are conspicuous and melancholy
      examples, which are cited oftener with malice than with pity. But I appeal
      to examples amongst our contemporaries, to which every man of literature
      will immediately advert, to prove, that where the female understanding has
      been properly cultivated, women have not only obtained admiration by their
      useful abilities, but respect by their exemplary conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      I apprehend that many of the errors into which women of literature have
      fallen, may have arisen from an improper choice of books. Those who read
      chiefly works of imagination, receive from them false ideas of life and of
      the human heart. Many of these productions I should keep as I would deadly
      poison from my child; I should rather endeavour to turn her attention to
      science than to romance, and to give her early that taste for truth and
      utility, which, when once implanted, can scarcely be eradicated. There is
      a wide difference between innocence and ignorance: ignorant women may have
      minds the most debased and perverted, whilst the most cultivated
      understanding may be united with the most perfect innocence and
      simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if literature were of no other use to the fair sex than to supply
      them with employment, I should think the time dedicated to the cultivation
      of their minds well bestowed: they are surely better occupied when they
      are reading or writing than when coqueting or gaming, losing their
      fortunes or their characters. You despise the writings of women:&mdash;you
      think that they might have made a better use of the pen, than to write
      plays, and poetry, and romances. Considering that the pen was to women a
      new instrument, I think they have made at least as good a use of it as
      learned men did of the needle some centuries ago, when they set themselves
      to determine how many spirits could stand upon its point, and were ready
      to tear one another to pieces in the discussion of this sublime question.
      Let the sexes mutually forgive each other their follies; or, what is much
      better, let them combine their talents for their general advantage.&mdash;You
      say, that the experiments we have made do not encourage us to proceed&mdash;that
      the increased care and pains which have been of late years bestowed upon
      female education have produced no adequate returns; but you in the same
      breath allow that amongst your contemporaries, whom you prudently forbear
      to mention, there are some instances of great talents applied to useful
      purposes. Did you expect that the fruits of good cultivation should appear
      before the seed was sown? You triumphantly enumerate the disadvantages to
      which women, from the laws and customs of society, are liable:&mdash;they
      cannot converse freely with men of wit, science, and learning, nor even
      with the artist, or artificers; they are excluded from academies, public
      libraries, &amp;c. Even our politeness prevents us, you say, from ever
      speaking plain truth and sense to the fair sex:&mdash;every assistance
      that foreign or domestic ingenuity can invent to encourage literary
      studies, is, as you boast, almost exclusively ours: and after pointing out
      all these causes for the inferiority of women in knowledge, you ask for a
      list of the inventions and discoveries of those who, by your own statement
      of the question, have not been allowed opportunities for observation. With
      the insulting injustice of an Egyptian task-master, you demand the work,
      and deny the necessary materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      I admit, that with respect to the opportunities of acquiring knowledge,
      institutions and manners are, as you have stated, much in favour of our
      sex; but your argument concerning <i>time</i> appears to me to be
      unfounded.&mdash;Women who do not love dissipation must have more time for
      the cultivation of their understandings than men can have, if you compute
      the whole of life:&mdash;whilst the knowledge of the learned languages
      continues to form an indispensable part of a gentleman&rsquo;s education, many
      years of childhood and youth must be devoted to their attainment.&mdash;During
      these studies, the general cultivation of the understanding is in some
      degree retarded. All the intellectual powers are cramped, except the
      memory, which is sufficiently exercised, but which is overloaded with
      words, and with words that are not always understood.&mdash;The genius of
      living and of dead languages differs so much, that the pains which are
      taken to write elegant Latin frequently spoil the English style.&mdash;Girls
      usually write much better than boys; they think and express their thoughts
      clearly at an age when young men can scarcely write an easy letter upon
      any common occasion. Women do not read the good authors of antiquity as
      school-books, but they can have excellent translations of most of them
      when they are capable of tasting the beauties of composition.&mdash;I know
      that it is supposed we cannot judge of the classics by translations, and I
      am sensible that much of the merit of the originals may be lost; but I
      think the difference in pleasure is more than overbalanced to women by the
      <i>time</i> that is saved, and by the labour and misapplication of
      abilities which are spared. If they do not acquire a classical taste,
      neither do they imbibe classic prejudices; nor are they early disgusted
      with literature by pedagogues, lexicons, grammars, and all the melancholy
      apparatus of learning.&mdash;Women begin to taste the pleasures of
      reading, and the best authors in the English language are their amusement,
      just at the age when young men, disgusted by their studies, begin to be
      ashamed of alluding to literature amongst their companions. Travelling,
      lounging, field sports, gaming, and what is called pleasure in various
      shapes, usually fill the interval between quitting the university and
      settling for life.&mdash;When this period is past, business, the necessity
      of pursuing a profession, the ambition to shine in parliament, or to rise
      in public life, occupy a large portion of their lives.&mdash;In many
      professions the understanding is but partially cultivated; and general
      literature must be neglected by those who are occupied in earning bread or
      amassing riches for their family:&mdash;men of genius are often heard to
      complain, that in the pursuit of a profession, they are obliged to
      contract their inquiries and concentrate their powers; statesmen lament
      that they must often pursue the <i>expedient</i> even when they discern
      that it is not <i>the right</i>; and men of letters, who earn their bread
      by their writings, inveigh bitterly against the tyranny of booksellers,
      who degrade them to the state of &ldquo;literary artisans.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Literary
      artisans,&rdquo; is the comprehensive term under which a celebrated philosopher
      {1} classes all those who cultivate only particular talents or powers of
      the mind, and who suffer their other faculties to lose all strength and
      vigour for want of exercise. The other sex have no such constraint upon
      their understandings; neither the necessity of earning their bread, nor
      the ambition to shine in public affairs, hurry or prejudice their minds:
      in domestic life they have leisure to be wise.

      Far from being ashamed that so little has been done by female abilities in
      science and useful literature, I am surprised that so much has been
      effected. On natural history, on criticism, on moral philosophy, on
      education, they have written with elegance, eloquence, precision, and
      ingenuity. Your complaint that women do not turn their attention to useful
      literature is surely ill-timed. If they merely increased the number of
      books in circulation, you might declaim against them with success; but
      when they add to the general fund of useful and entertaining knowledge,
      you cannot with any show of justice prohibit their labours: there can be
      no danger that the market should ever be overstocked with produce of
      intrinsic worth.

      The despotic monarchs of Spain forbid the exploring of any new gold or
      silver mines without the express permission of government, and they have
      ordered several rich ones to be shut up as not equal to the cost of
      working. There is some <i>appearance</i> of reason for this exertion of
      power: it may prevent the world from being encumbered by nominal wealth.&mdash;But
      the Dutch merchants, who burn whole cargoes of spice lest they should
      lower the price of the commodity in which they deal, show a mean spirit of
      monopoly which can plead no plausible excuse.&mdash;I hope you feel
      nothing like a disposition to Spanish despotism or Dutch jealousy, when
      you would exclude female talents from the literary market.

      You observe, that since censure is a tax which every man must pay who
      aspires to eminence, women must expect to pay it doubly. Why the tax
      should not be equally assessed, I am at a loss to conjecture: but in fact
      it does not fall very heavy upon those who have any portion of philosophy:
      they may, with <i>the poet of reason</i>, exclaim&mdash;

      Your dread of the envy attendant upon literary excellence might with equal
      justice be extended to every species of merit, and might be urged against
      all that is good in art or nature.&mdash;Scandal is said to attack always
      the fairest characters, as the birds always peck most at the ripest fruit;
      but would you for this reason have no fruit ripen, or no characters aspire
      to excellence? But if it be your opinion that women are naturally inferior
      to us in capacity, why do you feel so much apprehension of their becoming
      eminent, or of their obtaining power, in consequence of the cultivation of
      their understandings?&mdash;These expressions of scorn and jealousy
      neutralize each other. If your contempt were unmixed and genuine, it would
      be cool and tranquil, inclining rather to pity than to anger.

    <p>
      You say that in all animals the female is the inferior; and you have never
      seen any reason to believe that the human species affords an exception to
      this observation.&mdash;Superiority amongst brutes depends upon force;
      superiority amongst the human species depends upon reason: that men are
      naturally stronger than women is evident; but strength of mind has no
      necessary connexion with strength of body; and intellectual ability has
      ever conquered mere physical force, from the times of Ajax and Ulysses to
      the present day. In civilized nations, that species of superiority which
      belongs to force is much reduced in value amongst the higher classes of
      society.&mdash;The baron who struck his sword into an oak, and defied any
      one to pull out the weapon, would not in these days fill the hearts of his
      antagonists with terror; nor would the twisting of a horse-shoe be deemed
      a feat worthy to decide a nation in their choice of a king.&mdash;The days
      of chivalry are no more: the knight no longer sallies forth in ponderous
      armour, mounted upon &ldquo;a steed as invulnerable as himself{1}.&rdquo;&mdash;The
      damsel no longer depends upon the prowess of his mighty arm to maintain
      the glory of her charms, or the purity of her fame; grim barons, and
      castles guarded by monsters and all-devouring dragons, are no more; and
      from being the champions and masters of the fair sex, we are now become
      their friends and companions. We have not surely been losers by this
      change; the fading glories of romance have vanished, but the real
      permanent pleasures of domestic life remain in their stead; and what the
      fair have lost of adulation they have gained in friendship.

      Do not, my dear sir, call me a champion for the rights of woman; I am too
      much their friend to be their partisan, and I am more anxious for their
      happiness than intent upon a metaphysical discussion of their rights:
      their happiness is so nearly connected with ours, that it seems to me
      absurd to manage any argument so as to set the two sexes at variance by
      vain contention for superiority. It ought not to be our object to make an

      You fear that the minds of women should be enlarged and cultivated, lest
      their power in society and their liberty should consequently increase.
      Observe that the word <i>liberty</i>, applied to the female sex, conveys
      alarming ideas to our minds, because we do not stay to define the term; we
      have a confused notion that it implies want of reserve, want of delicacy;
      boldness of manners, or of conduct; in short, liberty to do wrong.&mdash;Surely
      this is a species of liberty which knowledge can never make desirable.
      Those who understand the real interests of society, who clearly see the
      connexion between virtue and happiness, must know that <i>the liberty to
      do wrong</i> is synonymous with <i>the liberty to make themselves
      miserable</i>. This is a privilege of which none would choose to avail
      themselves. When reason defines the term, there is no danger of its being
      misunderstood; but imagination and false associations often make this word
      liberty, in its perverted sense, sound delightful to those who have been
      kept in ignorance and slavery. Girls who have been disciplined under the
      strict high hand of authority, are apt to fancy that to escape from
      habitual restraint, to exercise their own will, no matter how, is to be
      free and to be happy.&mdash;Hence innumerable errors in their conduct;
      hence their mistaken notions of liberty, and that inordinate ambition to
      acquire power, which ignorant, ill-educated women show in every petty
      struggle, where they are permitted to act in private life. You believe
      this temper to be inherent in the sex; and a man, who has just published a
      book upon the Spanish bull-fights, declares his belief, that the passion
      for bull-fighting is innate in the breast of every Spaniard.&mdash;Do not,
      my friend, assign two causes for an effect where one is obviously
      adequate. The disposition to love command need not be attributed to any
      innate cause in the minds of females, whilst it may be fairly ascribed to
      their erroneous education.

      I shall early cultivate my daughter&rsquo;s judgment, to prevent her from being
      wilful or positive; I shall leave her to choose for herself in all those
      trifles upon which the happiness of childhood depends; and I shall
      gradually teach her to reflect upon the consequences of her actions, to
      compare and judge of her feelings, and to compute the morn and evening to
      her day.&mdash;I shall thus, I hope, induce her to reason upon all
      subjects, even upon matters of taste, where many women think it sufficient
      to say, I admire; or, I detest:&mdash;Oh, charming! or, Oh, horrible!&mdash;People
      who have reasons for their preferences and aversions, are never so
      provokingly zealous in the support of their own tastes, as those usually
      are who have no arguments to convince themselves or others that they are
      in the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you are apprehensive that the desire to govern, which women show in
      domestic life, should obtain a larger field to display itself in public
      affairs.&mdash;It seems to me impossible that they can ever acquire the
      species of direct power which you dread: their influence must be private;
      it is therefore of the utmost consequence that it should be judicious.&mdash;It
      was not Themistocles, but his wife and child, who governed the Athenians;
      it was therefore of some consequence that the boy who governed the mother,
      who governed her husband, should not be a spoiled child; and consequently
      that the mother who educated this child should be a reasonable woman. Thus
      are human affairs chained together; and female influence is a necessary
      and important link, which you cannot break without destroying the whole.

      If it be your object, my dear sir, to monopolize power for our sex, you
      cannot possibly secure it better from the wishes of the other, than by
      enlightening their minds and enlarging their views: they will then be
      convinced, not by the voice of the moralist, who puts us to sleep whilst
      he persuades us of the vanity of all sublunary enjoyments, but by their
      own awakened observation: they will be convinced that power is generally
      an evil to its possessor; that to those who really wish for the good of
      their fellow-creatures, it is at best but a painful trust.&mdash;The mad
      philosopher in Rasselas, who imagined that he regulated the weather and
      distributed the seasons, could never enjoy a moment&rsquo;s repose, lest he
      should not make &ldquo;to the different nations of the earth an impartial
      dividend of rain and sunshine.&rdquo;&mdash;Those who are entrusted with the
      government of nations must, if they have an acute sense of justice,
      experience something like the anxiety felt by this unfortunate monarch of
      the clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Kenyon has lately decided that a woman may <i>be an overseer of a
      parish</i>; but you are not, I suppose, apprehensive that many ladies of
      cultivated understanding should become ambitious of this honour.&mdash;One
      step farther in reasoning, and a woman would desire as little to be a
      queen or an empress, as to be the overseer of a parish.&mdash;You may
      perhaps reply, that men, even those of the greatest understanding, have
      been ambitious, and fond even to excess of power. That ambition is the
      glorious fault of heroes, I allow; but heroes are not always men of the
      most enlarged understandings&mdash;they are possessed by the spirit of
      military adventure&mdash;an infectious spirit, which men catch from one
      another in the course of their education:&mdash;to this contagion the fair
      sex are not exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all events, if you suppose that women are likely to acquire influence
      in the state, it is prudent to enlighten their understandings, that they
      may not make an absurd or pernicious use of their power. You appeal to
      history, to prove that great calamities have ensued whenever the female
      sex has obtained power; yet you acknowledge that we cannot with certainty
      determine whether these evils have been the effects of our trusting them
      with liberty, or of our neglecting previously to instruct them in the use
      of it:&mdash;upon the decision of this question rests your whole argument.
      In a most awful tone of declamation, you bid me follow the history of
      female nature, from the court of Augustus to that of Lewis XIVth, and tell
      you whether I can hesitate to acknowledge, that the liberty and influence
      of women have always been the greatest during the decline of empires.&mdash;But
      you have not proved to me that women had more knowledge, that they were
      better educated, at the court of Augustus, or during the reign of Lewis
      XIVth, than at any other place, or during any other period of the world;
      therefore your argument gains nothing by the admission of your assertions;
      and unless I could trace the history of female education, it is vain for
      me to follow what you call the history of female nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, however, remarkable, that the means by which the sex have hitherto
      obtained that species of power which they have abused, have arisen chiefly
      from their personal, and not from their mental qualifications; from their
      skill in the arts of persuasion, and from their accomplishments; not from
      their superior powers of reasoning, or from the cultivation of their
      understanding. The most refined species of coquetry can undoubtedly be
      practised in the highest perfection by women, who to personal graces unite
      all the fascination of wit and eloquence. There is infinite danger in
      permitting such women to obtain power without having acquired habits of
      reasoning. Rousseau admires these sirens; but the system of Rousseau,
      pursued to its fullest extent, would overturn the world, would make every
      woman a Cleopatra, and every man an Antony; it would destroy all domestic
      virtue, all domestic happiness, all the pleasures of truth and love.&mdash;In
      the midst of that delirium of passion to which Antony gave the name of
      love, what must have been the state of his degraded, wretched soul, when
      he could suspect his mistress of designs upon his life?&mdash;To cure him
      of these suspicions, she at a banquet poisoned the flowers of his garland,
      waited till she saw him inflamed with wine, then persuaded him to break
      the tops of his flowers into his goblet, and just stopped him when the cup
      was at his lips, exclaiming&mdash;&ldquo;Those flowers are poisoned: you see
      that I do not want the means of destroying you, if you were become
      tiresome to me, or if I could live without you.&rdquo;&mdash;And this is the
      happy pair who instituted the orders of <i>The inimitable lovers</i>!&mdash;and
      <i>The companions in death</i>!{1}

      These are the circumstances which should early be pointed out, to both
      sexes, with all the energy of truth: let them learn that the most
      exquisite arts of the most consummate coquette, could not obtain the
      confidence of him, who sacrificed to her charms, the empire of the world.
      It is from the experience of the past that we must form our judgment of
      the future. How unjustly you accuse me of desiring to destroy the memory
      of past experiments, the wisdom collected by the labour of ages! <i>You</i>
      would prohibit this treasure of knowledge to one-half of the human
      species; and <i>I</i> on the contrary would lay it open to all my
      fellow-creatures.&mdash;I speak as if it were actually in our option to
      retard or to accelerate the intellectual progress of the sex; but in fact
      it is absolutely out of our power to drive the fair sex back to their
      former state of darkness: the art of printing has totally changed their
      situation; their eyes are opened,&mdash;the classic page is unrolled, they
      <i>will</i> read:&mdash;all we can do is to induce them to read with
      judgment&mdash;to enlarge their minds so that they may take a full view of
      their interests and of ours. I have no fear that the truth upon any
      subject should injure my daughter&rsquo;s mind; it is falsehood that I dread. I
      dread that she should acquire preposterous notions of love, of happiness,
      from the furtive perusal of vulgar novels, or from the clandestine
      conversation of ignorant waiting-maids:&mdash;I dread that she should
      acquire, even from the enchanting eloquence of Rousseau, the fatal idea,
      that cunning and address are the natural resources of her sex; that
      coquetry is necessary to attract, and dissimulation to preserve the heart
      of man.&mdash;I would not, however, proscribe an author, because I believe
      some of his opinions to be false; I would have my daughter read and
      compare various books, and correct her judgment of books by listening to
      the conversation of persons of sense and experience. Women may learn much
      of what is essential to their happiness, from the unprejudiced testimony
      of a father or a brother; they may learn to distinguish the pictures of
      real life from paintings of imaginary manners and passions which never
      had, which never can have, any existence.&mdash;They may learn that it is
      not the reserve of hypocrisy, the affected demeanour either of a prude or
      a coquette, that we admire; but it is the simple, graceful, natural
      modesty of a woman, whose mind is innocent. With this belief impressed
      upon her heart, do you think, my dear friend, that she who can reflect and
      reason would take the means to disgust where she wishes to please? or that
      she would incur contempt, when she knows how to secure esteem?&mdash;Do
      you think that she will employ artifice to entangle some heedless heart,
      when she knows that every heart which can be so won is not worth the
      winning?&mdash;She will not look upon our sex either as dupes or tyrants;
      she will be aware of the important difference between evanescent passion,
      and that affection founded upon mutual esteem, which forms the permanent
      happiness of life.

      I am not apprehensive, my dear sir, that Cupid should be scared by the
      helmet of Minerva; he has conquered his idle, fears, and has been
      familiarized to Minerva and the Muses;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;And now of power his darts are found,
  Twice ten thousand times to wound{1}.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: See the introduction of Cupid to the Muses and Minerva, in a
      charming poem of Mrs. Barbauld&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;<i>The origin of song-writing</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Would
      it not afford a beautiful subject for a picture?}
    </p>
    <p>
      That the power of beauty over the human heart is infinitely increased by
      the associated ideas of virtue and intellectual excellence has been long
      acknowledged.&mdash;A set of features, however regular, inspire but little
      admiration or enthusiasm, unless they be irradiated by that sunshine of
      the soul which creates beauty. The expression of intelligent benevolence
      renders even homely features and cheeks of sorry grain{1} agreeable; and
      it has been observed, that the most lasting attachments have not always
      been excited by the most beautiful of the sex. As men have become more
      cultivated, they have attended more to the expression of amiable and
      estimable qualities in the female countenance; and in all probability the
      taste for this species of beauty will increase amongst the good and wise.
      When agreeable qualities are connected with the view of any particular
      form, we learn to love that form, though it may have no other merit. Women
      who have no pretensions to Grecian beauty may, if their countenances are
      expressive of good temper and good sense, have some chance of pleasing men
      of cultivated minds.&mdash;In an excellent Review{2} of Gillier&rsquo;s Essays
      on the Causes of the Perfection of Antique Sculpture, which I have just
      seen, it is observed, that our exclusive admiration of the physiognomy of
      the Greeks arises from prejudice, since the Grecian countenance cannot be
      necessarily associated with any of the perfections which now distinguish
      accomplished or excellent men. This remark in a popular periodical work
      shows that the public mind is not bigoted in matters of taste, and that
      the standard is no longer supposed to be fixed by the voice of ancient
      authority. The changes that are made in the opinions of our sex as to
      female beauty, according to the different situations in which women are
      placed, and the different qualities on which we fix the idea of their
      excellence, are curious and striking. Ask a northern Indian, says a
      traveller who has lately visited them, ask a northern Indian what is
      beauty? and he will answer, a broad flat face, small eyes, high cheek
      bones, three or four broad black lines across each cheek, a low forehead,
      a large broad chin, a clumsy hook nose, &amp;c. These beauties are greatly
      heightened, or at least rendered more valuable, when the possessor is
      capable of dressing all kinds of skins, converting them into the different
      parts of their clothing, and able to carry eight or ten stone in summer,
      or haul a much greater weight in winter.&mdash;Prince Matanabbee, adds
      this author, prided himself much upon the height and strength of his
      wives, and would frequently say, few women could carry or haul heavier
      loads. If, some years ago, you had asked a Frenchman what he meant by
      beauty, he would have talked to you of <i>l&rsquo;air piquant, l&rsquo;air spirituel,
      l&rsquo;air noble, l&rsquo;air comme il faut</i>, and he would have referred
      ultimately to that <i>je ne sçais quoi</i>, for which Parisian belles were
      formerly celebrated.&mdash;French women mixed much in company, the charms
      of what they called <i>esprit</i> were admired in conversation, and the <i>petit
      minois</i> denoting lively wit and coquetry became fashionable in France,
      whilst gallantry and a taste for the pleasures of <i>society</i>
      prevailed. The countenance expressive of sober sense and modest reserve
      continues to be the taste of the English, who wisely prefer the pleasures
      of domestic life.&mdash;Domestic life should, however, be enlivened and
      embellished with all the wit and vivacity and politeness for which French
      women were once admired, without admitting any of their vices or follies.
      The more men of literature and polished manners desire to spend their time
      in their own families, the more they must wish that their wives and
      daughters may have tastes and habits similar to their own. If they can
      meet with conversation suited to their taste at home, they will not be
      driven to clubs for companions; they will invite the men of wit and
      science of their acquaintance to their own houses, instead of appointing
      some place of meeting from which ladies are to be excluded. This mixture
      of the talents and knowledge of both sexes must be advantageous to the
      interests of society, by increasing domestic happiness.&mdash;Private <i>virtues</i>
      are public benefits: if each bee were content in his cell, there could be
      no grumbling hive; and if each cell were complete, the whole fabric must
      be perfect.

      When you asserted, my dear sir, that learned men usually prefer for their
      wives, women rather below than above the standard of mental mediocrity,
      you forgot many instances strongly in contradiction of this opinion.&mdash;Since
      I began this letter, I met with the following pathetic passage, which I
      cannot forbear transcribing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The greatest part of the observations contained in the foregoing pages
      were derived from a lady, who is now beyond the reach of being affected by
      any thing in this sublunary world. Her beneficence of disposition induced
      her never to overlook any fact or circumstance that fell within the sphere
      of her observation, which promised to be in any respect beneficial to her
      fellow-creatures. To her gentle influence the public are indebted, if they
      be indeed indebted at all, for whatever useful hints may at any time have
      dropped from my pen. A being, she thought, who must depend so much as man
      does on the assistance of others, owes, as a debt to his fellow-creatures,
      the communication of the little useful knowledge that chance may have
      thrown in his way. Such has been my constant aim; such were the views of
      the wife of my bosom, the friend of my heart, who supported and assisted
      me in all my pursuits.&mdash;I now feel a melancholy satisfaction in
      contemplating those objects she once delighted to elucidate."{1}

      and literature enjoy in an union with women who can sympathize in all
      their thoughts and feelings, who can converse with them as equals, and
      live with them as friends; who can assist them in the important and
      delightful duty of educating their children; who can make their family
      their most agreeable society, and their home the attractive centre of

    <h3>
      JULIA TO CAROLINE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In vain, dear Caroline, you urge me to <i>think</i>; I profess only to <i>feel</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Reflect upon my own feelings!</i> Analyze my notions of happiness!
      explain to you my system!&rdquo;&mdash;My system! But I have no system: that is
      the very difference between us. My notions of happiness cannot be resolved
      into simple, fixed principles. Nor dare I even attempt to analyze them;
      the subtle essence would escape in the process: just punishment to the
      alchymist in morality!
    </p>
    <p>
      You, Caroline, are of a more sedate, contemplative character. Philosophy
      becomes the rigid mistress of your life, enchanting enthusiasm the
      companion of mine. Suppose she lead me now and then in pursuit of a
      meteor; am not I happy in the chase? When one illusion vanishes, another
      shall appear, and, still leading me forward towards an horizon that
      retreats as I advance, the happy prospect of futurity shall vanish only
      with my existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reflect upon my feelings!&rdquo;&mdash;Dear Caroline, is it not enough that I
      do feel?&mdash;All that I dread is that <i>apathy</i> which philosophers
      call tranquillity. You tell me that by continually <i>indulging</i>, I
      shall weaken my natural sensibility;&mdash;are not all the faculties of
      the soul improved, refined by exercise? and why shall <i>this</i> be
      excepted from the general law?
    </p>
    <p>
      But I must not, you tell me, indulge my taste for romance and poetry, lest
      I waste that sympathy on <i>fiction</i> which <i>reality</i> so much
      better deserves. My dear friend, let us cherish the precious propensity to
      pity! no matter what the object; sympathy with fiction or reality arises
      from the same disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the sigh of compassion rises in my bosom, when the spontaneous tear
      starts from my eye, what frigid moralist shall &ldquo;stop the genial current of
      the soul?&rdquo; shall say to the tide of passion, <i>So far shall thou go, and
      no farther?</i>&mdash;Shall man presume to circumscribe that which
      Providence has left unbounded?
    </p>
    <p>
      But oh, Caroline! if our feelings as well as our days are numbered; if, by
      the immutable law of nature, apathy be the sleep of passion, and languor
      the necessary consequence of exertion; if indeed the pleasures of life are
      so ill proportioned to its duration, oh, may that duration be shortened to
      me!&mdash;Kind Heaven, let not my soul die before my body!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, if at this instant my guardian genius were to appear before me, and
      offering me the choice of my future destiny; on the one hand, the even
      temper, the poised judgment, the stoical serenity of philosophy; on the
      other, the eager genius, the exquisite sensibility of enthusiasm: if the
      genius said to me, &ldquo;Choose&rdquo;&mdash;the lot of the one is great pleasure,
      and great pain&mdash;great virtues, and great defects&mdash;ardent hope,
      and severe disappointment&mdash;ecstasy, and despair:&mdash;the lot of the
      other is calm happiness unmixed with violent grief&mdash;virtue without
      heroism&mdash;respect without admiration&mdash;and a length of life, in
      which to every moment is allotted its proper portion of felicity:&mdash;Gracious
      genius! I should exclaim, if half my existence must be the sacrifice, take
      it; <i>enthusiasm is my choice</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, my dear friend, would be my choice were I a man; as a woman, how
      much more readily should I determine!
    </p>
    <p>
      What has woman to do with philosophy? The graces flourish not under her
      empire: a woman&rsquo;s part in life is to please, and Providence has assigned
      to her <i>success</i>, all the pride and pleasure of her being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then leave us our weakness, leave us our follies; they are our best arms:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Leave us to trifle with more grace and ease,
  Whom folly pleases and whose follies please&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The moment grave sense and solid merit appear, adieu the bewitching
      caprice, the &ldquo;<i>lively nonsense</i>,&rdquo; the exquisite, yet childish
      susceptibility which charms, interests, captivates.&mdash;Believe me, our
      <i>amiable defects</i> win more than our noblest virtues. Love requires
      sympathy, and sympathy is seldom connected with a sense of superiority. I
      envy none their &ldquo;<i>painful pre-eminence</i>.&rdquo; Alas! whether it be
      deformity or excellence which makes us say with Richard the Third,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I am myself alone!&rdquo;

      it comes to much the same thing. Then let us, Caroline, content ourselves
      to gain in love, what we lose in esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Man is to be held only by the <i>slightest</i> chains; with the idea that
      he can break them at pleasure, he submits to them in sport; but his pride
      revolts against the power to which his <i>reason</i> tells him he ought to
      submit. What then can woman gain by reason? Can she prove by argument that
      she is amiable? or demonstrate that she is an angel?
    </p>
    <p>
      Vain was the industry of the artist, who, to produce the image of perfect
      beauty, selected from the fairest faces their most faultless features.
      Equally vain must be the efforts of the philosopher, who would excite the
      idea of mental perfection, by combining an assemblage of party-coloured
      virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, I had almost said, is my <i>system</i>, but I mean my <i>sentiments</i>.
      I am not accurate enough to compose a <i>system</i>. After all, how vain
      are systems, and theories, and reasonings!
    </p>
    <p>
      We may <i>declaim</i>, but what do we really know? All is uncertainty&mdash;human
      prudence does nothing&mdash;fortune every thing: I leave every thing
      therefore to fortune; <i>you</i> leave nothing. Such is the difference
      between us,&mdash;and which shall be the happiest, time alone can decide.
      Farewell, dear Caroline; I love you better than I thought I could love a
      philosopher.

      Your ever affectionate

      LETTER II.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      CAROLINE&rsquo;S ANSWER TO JULIA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      At the hazard of ceasing to be &ldquo;<i>charming</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>interesting</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>captivating</i>,&rdquo;
       I must, dear Julia, venture to reason with you, to examine your favourite
      doctrine of &ldquo;<i>amiable defects</i>,&rdquo; and, if possible, to dissipate that
      unjust dread of perfection which you seem to have continually before your
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the sole object of a woman&rsquo;s life, you say, to <i>please</i>. Her
      amiable defects <i>please</i> more than her noblest virtues, her follies
      more than her wisdom, her caprice more than her temper, and <i>something</i>,
      a nameless something, which no art can imitate and no science can teach,
      more than all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Art</i>, you say, spoils the graces, and corrupts the heart of woman;
      and at best can produce only a cold model of perfection; which though
      perhaps strictly conformable to <i>rule</i>, can never touch the soul, or
      please the unprejudiced taste, like one simple stroke of genuine nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have often observed, dear Julia, that an inaccurate use of words
      produces such a strange confusion in all reasoning, that in the heat of
      debate, the combatants, unable to distinguish their friends from their
      foes, fall promiscuously on both. A skilful disputant knows well how to
      take advantage of this confusion, and sometimes endeavours to create it. I
      do not know whether I am to suspect you of such a design; but I must guard
      against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have with great address availed yourself of the <i>two</i> ideas
      connected with the word <i>art</i>: first, as opposed to simplicity, it
      implies artifice; and next, as opposed to ignorance, it comprehends all
      the improvements of science, which leading us to search for general
      causes, rewards us with a dominion over their dependent effects:&mdash;that
      which instructs how to pursue the objects which we may have in view with
      the greatest probability of success. All men who act from general
      principles are so far philosophers. Their objects may be, when attained,
      insufficient to their happiness, or they may not previously have known all
      the necessary means to obtain them: but they must not therefore complain,
      if they do not meet with success which they have no reason to expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parrhasius, in collecting the most admired excellences from various
      models, to produce perfection, concluded, from general principles that
      mankind would be pleased again with what had once excited their
      admiration.&mdash;So far he was a philosopher: but he was disappointed of
      success:&mdash;yes, for he was ignorant of the cause necessary to produce
      it. The separate features might be perfect, but they were unsuited to each
      other, and in their forced union he could not give to the whole
      countenance symmetry and an appropriate expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, as you say, a <i>something</i> wanting, which his science had
      not taught him. He should then have set himself to examine what that <i>something</i>
      was, and how it was to be obtained. His want of success arose from the <i>insufficiency</i>,
      not the <i>fallacy</i>, of theory. Your object, dear Julia, we will
      suppose is &ldquo;to please.&rdquo; If general observation and experience have taught
      you, that slight accomplishments and a trivial character succeed more
      certainly in obtaining this end, than higher worth and sense, you act from
      principle in rejecting the one and aiming at the other. You have
      discovered, or think you have discovered, the secret causes which produce
      the desired effect, and you employ them. Do not call this <i>instinct</i>
      or <i>nature</i>; this also, though you scorn it, is <i>philosophy</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when you come soberly to reflect, you have a feeling in your mind,
      that reason and cool judgment disapprove of the part you are acting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us, however, distinguish between disapprobation of the <i>object</i>,
      and the means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Averse as enthusiasm is from the retrograde motion of analysis, let me, my
      dear friend, lead you one step backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Why</i> do you wish to please? I except at present from the question,
      the desire to please, arising from a passion which requires a reciprocal
      return. Confined as <i>this</i> wish must be in a woman&rsquo;s heart to one
      object alone, when you say, Julia, <i>that the admiration of others</i>
      will be absolutely necessary to your happiness, I must suppose you mean to
      express only a <i>general</i> desire to please?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then under this limitation&mdash;let me ask you again, why do you wish to
      please?
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not let a word stop you. The word <i>vanity</i> conveys to us a
      disagreeable idea. There seems something <i>selfish</i> in the sentiment&mdash;that
      all the pleasure we feel in pleasing others arises from the gratification
      it affords to our own <i>vanity</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We refine, and explain, and never can bring ourselves fairly to make a
      confession, which we are sensible must lower us in the opinion of others,
      and consequently mortify the very <i>vanity</i> we would conceal. So
      strangely then do we deceive ourselves as to deny the existence of a
      motive, which at the instant prompts the denial. But let us, dear Julia,
      exchange the word <i>vanity</i> for a less odious word, self-complacency;
      let us acknowledge that we wish to please, because the success raises our
      self-complacency. If you ask why raising our self-approbation gives us
      pleasure, I must answer, that I do not know. Yet I see and feel that it
      does; I observe that the voice of numbers is capable of raising the
      highest transport or the most fatal despair. The eye of man seems to
      possess a fascinating power over his fellow-creatures, to raise the blush
      of shame, or the glow of pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      I look around me, and I see riches, titles, dignities, pursued with such
      eagerness by thousands, only as the signs of distinction. Nay, are not all
      these things sacrificed the moment they cease to be distinctions? The
      moment the prize of glory is to be won by other means, do not millions
      sacrifice their fortunes, their peace, their health, their lives, for <i>fame</i>?
      Then amongst the highest pleasures of human beings I must place
      self-approbation. With this belief, let us endeavour to secure it in the
      greatest extent, and to the longest duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, Julia, the wish to please becomes only a secondary motive,
      subordinate to the desire I have to secure my own self-complacency. We
      will examine how far they are connected.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reflecting upon my own mind, I observe that I am flattered by the
      opinion of others, in proportion to the opinion I have previously formed
      of their judgment; or I perceive that the opinion of numbers, merely as
      numbers, has power to give me great pleasure or great pain. I would unite
      both these pleasures if I could, but in general I cannot&mdash;they are
      incompatible. The opinion of the vulgar crowd and the enlightened
      individual, the applause of the highest and the lowest of mankind, cannot
      be obtained by the same means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another question then arises,&mdash;whom shall we wish to please? We must
      choose, and be decided in the choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      You say that you are proud; I am prouder.&mdash;You will be content with
      indiscriminate admiration&mdash;nothing will content me but what is <i>select</i>.
      As long as I have the use of my reason&mdash;as long as my heart can feel
      the delightful sense of a &ldquo;well-earned praise,&rdquo; I will fix my eye on the
      highest pitch of excellence, and steadily endeavour to attain it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conscious of her worth, and daring to assert it, I would have a woman
      early in life know that she is capable of filling the heart of a man of
      sense and merit; that she is worthy to be his companion and friend. With
      all the energy of her soul, with all the powers of her understanding, I
      would have a woman endeavour to please those whom she esteems and loves.
    </p>
    <p>
      She runs a risk, you will say, of never meeting her equal. Hearts and
      understandings of a superior order are seldom met with in the world; or
      when met with, it may not be a particular good fortune to win them.&mdash;True;
      but if ever she <i>wins</i>, she will <i>keep</i> them; and the prize
      appears to me well worth the pains and difficulty of attaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      I, Julia, admire and feel enthusiasm; but I would have philosophy directed
      to the highest objects. I dread apathy as much as you can; and I would
      endeavour to prevent it, not by sacrificing half my existence, but by
      enjoying the whole with moderation.
    </p>
    <p>
      You ask, why exercise does not increase sensibility, and why sympathy with
      imaginary distress will not also increase the disposition to sympathize
      with what is real?&mdash;Because pity should, I think, always be
      associated with the active desire to relieve. If it be suffered to become
      a <i>passive sensation</i>, it is a <i>useless weakness</i>, not a virtue.
      The species of reading you speak of must be hurtful, even in this respect,
      to the mind, as it indulges all the luxury of woe in sympathy with
      fictitious distress, without requiring the exertion which reality demands:
      besides, universal experience proves to us that habit, so far from
      increasing sensibility, absolutely destroys it, by familiarizing it with
      objects of compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me, my dear friend, appeal even to your own experience in the very
      instance you mention. Is there any pathetic writer in the world who could
      move you as much at the &ldquo;twentieth reading as at the first{1}?&rdquo; Speak
      naturally, and at the third or fourth reading, you would probably say, It
      is very pathetic, but I have read it before&mdash;I liked it better the
      first time; that is to say, it <i>did</i> touch me once&mdash;I know it <i>ought</i>
      to touch me now, but it <i>does not</i>. Beware of this! Do not let life
      become <i>as tedious as a twice-told tale</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farewell, dear Julia: this is the answer of fact against eloquence,
      philosophy against enthusiasm. You appeal from my understanding to my
      heart&mdash;I appeal from the heart to the understanding of my judge; and
      ten years hence the decision perhaps will be in my favour.
    </p>
    <p>

      LETTER III.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      CAROLINE TO JULIA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>On her intended marriage.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, my dear Julia, I hardly know how to venture to give you my advice
      upon a subject which ought to depend so much upon your own taste and
      feelings. My opinion and my wishes I could readily tell you: the idea of
      seeing you united and attached to my brother is certainly the most
      agreeable to me; but I am to divest myself of the partiality of a sister,
      and to consider my brother and Lord V&mdash;&mdash; as equal candidates
      for your preference&mdash;equal, I mean, in your regard; for you say that
      &ldquo;Your heart is not yet decided in its choice.&mdash;If that oracle would
      declare itself in intelligible terms, you would not hesitate a moment to
      obey its dictates.&rdquo; But, my dear Julia, is there not another, a <i>safer</i>,
      I do not say a <i>better</i> oracle, to be consulted&mdash;your reason?
      Whilst the &ldquo;doubtful beam still nods from side to side,&rdquo; you may with a
      steady hand weigh your own motives, and determine what things will be
      essential to your happiness, and what <i>price</i> you will pay for them;
      for
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Each pleasure has its <i>price</i>; and they who pay
  Too much of pain, but squander life away.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Do me the justice to believe that I do not quote these lines of Dryden as
      being the finest poetry he ever wrote; for poets, you know, as Waller
      wittily observed, never succeed so well in truth as in fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we cannot in life expect to realize all our wishes, we must
      distinguish those which claim the rank of wants. We must separate the
      fanciful from the real, or at least make the one subservient to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is of the utmost importance to you, more particularly, to take every
      precaution before you decide for life, because disappointment and
      restraint afterwards would be insupportable to your temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have often declared to me, my dear friend, that your love of poetry,
      and of all the refinements of literary and romantic pursuits, is so
      intimately &ldquo;interwoven in your mind, that nothing could separate them,
      without destroying the whole fabric.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Your tastes, you say, are fixed; if they are so, you must be doubly
      careful to ensure their gratification. If you cannot make <i>them</i>
      subservient to external circumstances, you should certainly, if it be in
      your power, choose a situation in which circumstances will be subservient
      to them. If you are convinced that you could not adopt the tastes of
      another, it will be absolutely necessary for your happiness to live with
      one whose tastes are similar to your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The belief in that sympathy of souls, which the poets suppose declares
      itself between two people at first sight, is perhaps as absurd as the late
      fashionable belief in animal magnetism: but there is a sympathy which, if
      it be not the foundation, may be called the cement of affection. Two
      people could not, I should think, retain any lasting affection for each
      other, without a mutual sympathy in taste and in their diurnal occupations
      and domestic pleasures. This, you will allow, my dear Julia, even in a
      fuller extent than I do. Now, my brother&rsquo;s tastes, character, and habits
      of life, are so very different from Lord V&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s, that I
      scarcely know how you can compare them; at least before you can decide
      which of the two would make you the happiest in life, you must determine
      what kind of life you may wish to lead; for my brother, though he might
      make you very happy in domestic life, would not make the Countess of V&mdash;&mdash;
      happy; nor would Lord V&mdash;&mdash; make Mrs. Percy happy. They must be
      two different women, with different habits, and different wishes; so that
      you must divide yourself, my dear Julia, like Araspes, into two selves; I
      do not say into a bad and a good self; choose some other epithets to
      distinguish them, but distinct they must be: so let them now declare and
      decide their pretensions; and let the victor have not only the honours of
      a triumph, but all the prerogatives of victory. Let the subdued be subdued
      for life&mdash;let the victor take every precaution which policy can
      dictate, to prevent the possibility of future contests with the
      vanquished.
    </p>
    <p>
      But without talking poetry to you, my dear friend, let me seriously
      recommend it to you to examine your own mind carefully; and if you find
      that public diversions and public admiration, dissipation, and all the
      pleasures of riches and high rank, are really and truly essential to your
      happiness, direct your choice accordingly. Marry Lord V&mdash;&mdash;: he
      has a large fortune, extensive connexions, and an exalted station; his own
      taste for show and expense, his family pride, and personal vanity, will
      all tend to the end you propose. Your house, table, equipages, may be all
      in the highest style of magnificence. Lord V&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s easiness of
      temper, and fondness for you, will readily give you that entire ascendancy
      over his pleasures, which your abilities give you over his understanding.
      He will not control your wishes; you may gratify them to the utmost bounds
      of his fortune, and perhaps beyond those bounds; you may have entire
      command at home and abroad. If these are your objects, Julia, take them;
      they are in your power. But remember, you must take them with their
      necessary concomitants&mdash;the restraints upon your time, upon the
      choice of your friends and your company, which high life imposes; the <i>ennui</i>
      subsequent to dissipation; the mortifications of rivalship in beauty, wit,
      rank, and magnificence; the trouble of managing a large fortune, and the
      chance of involving your affairs and your family in difficulty and
      distress; these and a thousand more evils you must submit to. You must
      renounce all the pleasures of the heart and of the imagination; you must
      give up the idea of cultivating literary taste; you must not expect from
      your husband friendship and confidence, or any of the delicacies of
      affection:&mdash;you govern him, he cannot therefore be your equal; you
      may be a fond mother, but you cannot educate your children; you will
      neither have the time nor the power to do it; you must trust them to a
      governess. In the selection of your friends, and in the enjoyment of their
      company and conversation, you will be still more restrained: in short, you
      must give up the pleasures of domestic life; for that is not in this case
      the life you have chosen. But you will exclaim against me for supposing
      you capable of making such a choice&mdash;such sacrifices!&mdash;I am
      sure, <i>next to my brother</i>, I am the last person in the world who
      would wish you to make them.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have another choice, my dear Julia: domestic life is offered to you by
      one who has every wish and every power to make it agreeable to you; by one
      whose tastes resemble your own; who would be a judge and a fond admirer of
      all your perfections. You would have perpetual motives to cultivate every
      talent, and to exert every power of pleasing for his sake&mdash;for <i>his</i>
      sake, whose penetration no improvement would escape, and whose affection
      would be susceptible of every proof of yours. Am I drawing too flattering
      a picture?&mdash;A sister&rsquo;s hand may draw a partial likeness, but still it
      will be a likeness. At all events, my dear Julia, you would be certain of
      the mode of life you would lead with my brother. The regulation of your
      time and occupations would be your own. In the education of your family,
      you would meet with no interruptions or restraint. You would have no
      governess to counteract, no strangers to intrude; you might follow your
      own judgment, or yield to the judgment of one who would never require you
      to submit to his opinion, but to his reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the pleasures of friendship you would enjoy in your own family in the
      highest perfection, and you would have for your sister the friend of your
      infancy,

      CAROLINE TO LADY V&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>Upon her intended separation from her husband.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      You need not fear, my dear Lady V&mdash;&mdash;, that I should triumph in
      the accomplishment of my prophecies; or that I should reproach you for
      having preferred your own opinion to my advice. Believe me, my dear Julia,
      I am your friend, nor would the name of sister have increased my
      friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five years have made then so great a change in your feelings and views of
      life, that a few days ago, when my letter to you on your marriage
      accidentally fell into your hands, &ldquo;<i>you were struck with a species of
      astonishment at your choice, and you burst into tears in an agony of
      despair, on reading the wretched doom foretold to the wife of Lord V&mdash;&mdash;.
      A doom,</i>&rdquo; you add, &ldquo;<i>which I feel hourly accomplishing, and which I
      see no possibility of averting, but by a separation from a husband, with
      whom, I now think, it was madness to unite myself.</i>&rdquo; Your opinion I
      must already know upon this subject, &ldquo;<i>as the same arguments which
      should have prevented me from making such a choice, ought now to determine
      me to abjure it.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You say, dear Julia, that my letter struck you with despair.&mdash;Despair
      is either madness or folly; it obtains, it deserves nothing from mankind
      but pity; and pity, though it be akin to love, has yet a secret affinity
      to contempt. In strong minds, despair is an acute disease; the prelude to
      great exertion. In weak minds, it is a chronic distemper, followed by
      incurable indolence. Let the crisis be favourable, and resume your wonted
      energy. Instead of suffering the imagination to dwell with unavailing
      sorrow on the past, let us turn our attention towards the future. When an
      evil is irremediable, let us acknowledge it to be such, and bear it:&mdash;there
      is no power to which we submit so certainly as to necessity. With our
      hopes, our wishes cease. Imagination has a contracting, as well as an
      expansive faculty. The prisoner, who, deprived of all that we conceive to
      constitute the pleasures of life, could interest or occupy himself with
      the labours of a spider, was certainly a philosopher. He enjoyed all the
      means of happiness that were left in his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know, my dear Lady V&mdash;&mdash;, that words have little effect over
      grief; and I do not, I assure you, mean to insult you with the parade of
      stoic philosophy. But consider, your error is not perhaps so great as you
      imagine. Certainly, they who at the beginning of life can with a steady
      eye look through the long perspective of distant years, who can in one
      view comprise all the different objects of happiness and misery, who can
      compare accurately, and justly estimate their respective degrees of
      importance; and who, after having formed such a calculation, are capable
      of acting uniformly, in consequence of their own conviction, are the <i>wisest</i>,
      and, as far as prudence can influence our fortune, the <i>happiest</i> of
      human beings. Next to this favoured class are those who can perceive and
      repair their own errors; who can stop at any given period to take a new
      view of life. If unfortunate circumstances have denied you a place in the
      first rank, you may, dear Julia, secure yourself a station in the second.
      Is not the conduct of a woman, after her marriage, of infinitely more
      importance than her previous choice, whatever it may have been? Then now
      consider what yours should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      You say that it is easier to <i>break</i> a chain than to <i>stretch</i>
      it; but remember that when broken, your part of the chain, Julia, will
      still remain with you, and fetter and disgrace you through life. Why
      should a woman be so circumspect in her choice? Is it not because when
      once made she must abide by it? &ldquo;She sets her life upon the cast, and she
      must stand the hazard of the die.&rdquo; From domestic uneasiness a man has a
      thousand resources: in middling life, the tavern, in high life, the
      gaming-table, suspends the anxiety of thought. Dissipation, ambition,
      business, the occupation of a profession, change of place, change of
      company, afford him agreeable and honourable relief from domestic chagrin.
      If his home become tiresome, he leaves it; if his wife become disagreeable
      to him, he leaves her, and in leaving her loses <i>only</i> a wife. But
      what resource has a woman?&mdash;Precluded from all the occupations common
      to the other sex, she loses even those peculiar to her own. She has no
      remedy, from the company of a man she dislikes, but a separation; and this
      remedy, desperate as it is, is allowed only to a certain class of women in
      society; to those whose fortune affords them the means of subsistence, and
      whose friends have secured to them a separate maintenance. A peeress then,
      probably, can leave her husband if she wish it; a peasant&rsquo;s wife cannot;
      she depends upon the character and privileges of a wife for actual
      subsistence. Her domestic care, if not her affection, is secured to her
      husband; and it is just that it should. He sacrifices his liberty, his
      labour, his ingenuity, his time, for the support and protection of his
      wife; and in proportion to his protection is his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      In higher life, where the sacrifices of both parties in the original union
      are more equal, the evils of a separation are more nearly balanced. But
      even here, the wife who has hazarded least, suffers the most by the
      dissolution of the partnership; she loses a great part of her fortune, and
      of the conveniences and luxuries of life. She loses her home, her rank in
      society. She loses both the repellant and the attractive power of a
      mistress of a family. &ldquo;Her occupation is gone.&rdquo; She becomes a wanderer.
      Whilst her youth and beauty last, she may enjoy that species of delirium,
      caused by public admiration; fortunate if habit does not destroy the power
      of this charm, before the season of its duration expire. It was said to be
      the wish of a celebrated modern beauty, &ldquo;that she might not survive her
      nine-and-twentieth birth-day.&rdquo; I have often heard this wish quoted for its
      extravagance; but I always admired it for its good sense. The lady foresaw
      the inevitable doom of her declining years. Her apprehensions for the
      future embittered even her enjoyment of the present; and she had
      resolution enough to offer to take &ldquo;a bond of fate,&rdquo; to sacrifice one-half
      of her life, to secure the pleasure of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, dear Lady V&mdash;&mdash;, probably this wish was made at some
      distance from the destined period of its accomplishment. On the eve of her
      nine-and-twentieth birth-day, the lady perhaps might have felt inclined to
      retract her prayer. At least we should provide for the cowardice which
      might seize the female mind at such an instant. Even the most wretched
      life has power to attach us; none can be more wretched than the old age of
      a dissipated beauty:&mdash;unless, Lady V&mdash;&mdash;, it be that of a
      woman, who, to all her evils has the addition of remorse, for having
      abjured her duties and abandoned her family. Such is the situation of a
      woman who separates from her husband. Reduced to go the same insipid round
      of public amusements, yet more restrained than an unmarried beauty in
      youth, yet more miserable in age, the superiority of her genius and the
      sensibility of her heart become her greatest evils. She, indeed, must pray
      for indifference. Avoided by all her family connexions, hated and despised
      where she might have been loved and respected, solitary in the midst of
      society, she feels herself deserted at the time of life when she most
      wants social comfort and assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Julia, whilst it is yet in your power secure to yourself a happier
      fate; retire to the bosom of your own family; prepare for yourself a new
      society; perform the duties, and you shall soon enjoy the pleasures of
      domestic life; educate your children; whilst they are young, it shall be
      your occupation; as they grow up, it shall be your glory. Let me
      anticipate your future success, when they shall appear such as you can
      make them; when the world shall ask &ldquo;who educated these amiable young
      women? Who formed their character? Who cultivated the talents of this
      promising young man? Why does this whole family live together in such
      perfect union?&rdquo; With one voice, dear Julia, your children shall name their
      mother; she who in the bloom of youth checked herself in the career of
      dissipation, and turned all the ability and energy of her mind to their
      education.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such will be your future fame. In the mean time, before you have formed
      for yourself companions in your own family, you will want a society suited
      to your taste. &ldquo;Disgusted as you have been with frivolous company, you say
      that you wish to draw around you a society of literary and estimable
      friends, whose conversation and talents shall delight you, and who at the
      same time that they are excited to display their own abilities, shall be a
      judge of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, dear Lady V&mdash;&mdash;, the possibility of your forming such a
      society must depend on your having a home to receive, a character and
      consequence in life to invite and attach friends. The opinion of numbers
      is necessary to excite the ambition of individuals. To be a female
      Mecaenas you must have power to confer favours, as well as judgment to
      discern merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      What castles in the air are built by the synthetic wand of imagination,
      which vanish when exposed to the analysis of reason!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, Julia, supposing that Lord V&mdash;&mdash;, as your husband, becomes
      a negative quantity as to your happiness, yet he will acquire another
      species of value as the master of your family and the father of your
      children; as a person who supports your public consequence, and your
      private self-complacency. Yes, dear Lady V&mdash;&mdash;, he will increase
      your self-complacency; for do you not think, that when your husband sees
      his children prosper under your care, his family united under your
      management&mdash;whilst he feels your merit at home, and hears your
      praises abroad, do you not think he will himself learn to respect and love
      you? You say that &ldquo;<i>he is not a judge of female excellence; that he has
      no real taste; that vanity is his ruling passion</i>.&rdquo; Then if his
      judgment be dependent on the opinions of others, he will be the more
      easily led by the public voice, and you will command the suffrages of the
      public. If he has not taste enough to approve, he will have vanity enough
      to be proud of you; and a vain man insensibly begins to love that of which
      he is proud. Why does Lord V&mdash;&mdash; love his buildings, his
      paintings, his equipages? It is not for their intrinsic value; but because
      they are means of distinction to him. Let his wife become a greater
      distinction to him, and on the same principles he will prefer her. Set an
      example, then, dear Lady V&mdash;&mdash;, of domestic virtue; your talents
      shall make it admired, your rank shall make it conspicuous. You are
      ambitious, Julia, you love praise; you have been used to it; you cannot
      live happily without it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Praise is a mental luxury, which becomes from habit absolutely necessary
      to our existence; and in purchasing it we must pay the price set upon it
      by society. The more curious, the more avaricious we become of this
      &ldquo;aerial coin,&rdquo; the more it is our interest to preserve its currency and
      increase its value. You, my dear Julia, in particular, who have amassed so
      much of it, should not cry down its price, for your own sake!&mdash;Do not
      then say in a fit of disgust, that &ldquo;you are grown too wise now to value
      applause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If, during youth, your appetite for applause was indiscriminate, and
      indulged to excess, you are now more difficult in your choice, and are
      become an <i>epicure</i> in your <i>taste</i> for praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adieu, my dear Julia; I hope still to see you as happy in domestic life as
    </p>
    <p>
      Your ever affectionate and sincere friend,
    </p>

    <h3>
      LETTER V.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      CAROLINE TO LADY V&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>On her conduct after her separation from her husband.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      A delicacy, of which I now begin to repent, has of late prevented me from
      writing to you. I am afraid I shall be abrupt, but it is necessary to be
      explicit. Your conduct, ever since your separation from your husband, has
      been anxiously watched from a variety of motives, by his family and your
      own;&mdash;it has been blamed. Reflect upon your own mind, and examine
      with what justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last summer, when I was with you, I observed a change in your
      conversation, and the whole turn of your thoughts. I perceived an unusual
      impatience of restraint; a confusion in your ideas when you began to
      reason,&mdash;an eloquence in your language when you began to declaim,
      which convinced me that from some secret cause the powers of your reason
      had been declining, and those of your imagination rapidly increasing; the
      boundaries of right and wrong seemed to be no longer marked in your mind.
      Neither the rational hope of happiness, nor a sense of duty governed you;
      but some unknown, wayward power seemed to have taken possession of your
      understanding, and to have thrown every thing into confusion. You appeared
      peculiarly averse to philosophy: let me recall your own words to you; you
      asked &ldquo;of what use philosophy could be to beings who had no free will, and
      how the ideas of just punishment and involuntary crime could be
      reconciled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Your understanding involved itself in metaphysical absurdity. In
      conversing upon literary subjects one evening, in speaking of the striking
      difference between the conduct and the understanding of the great Lord
      Bacon, you said, that &ldquo;It by no means surprised you; that to an enlarged
      mind, accustomed to consider the universe as one vast <i>whole</i>, the
      conduct of that little animated atom, that inconsiderable part <i>self</i>,
      must be too insignificant to fix or merit attention. It was nothing,&rdquo; you
      said, &ldquo;in the general mass of vice and virtue, happiness and misery.&rdquo; I
      believe I answered, &ldquo;that it might be <i>nothing</i> compared to the great
      <i>whole</i>, but it was <i>every thing</i> to the individual.&rdquo; Such were
      your opinions in theory; you must know enough of the human heart to
      perceive their tendency when reduced to practice. Speculative opinions, I
      know, have little influence over the practice of those who <i>act</i> much
      and think little; but I should conceive their power to be considerable
      over the conduct of those who have much time for reflection and little
      necessity for action. In one case the habit of action governs the thoughts
      upon any sudden emergency; in the other, the thoughts govern the actions.
      The truth or falsehood then of speculative opinions is of much greater
      consequence to our sex than to the other; as we live a life of reflection,
      they of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Retrace, then, dear Julia, in your mind the course of your thoughts for
      some time past; discover the cause of this revolution in your opinions;
      judge yourself; and remember, that in the <i>mind</i> as well as in the
      body, the highest pitch of disease is often attended with an
      unconsciousness of its existence. If, then, Lady V&mdash;&mdash;, upon
      receiving my letter, you should feel averse to this self-examination, or
      if you should imagine it to be useless, I no longer advise, I command you
      to quit your present abode; come to me: fly from the danger, and be safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Julia, I must assume this peremptory tone: if you are angry, I must
      disregard your anger; it is the anger of disease, the anger of one who is
      roused from that sleep which would end in death.
    </p>
    <p>
      I respect the equality of friendship; but this equality permits, nay
      requires, the temporary ascendancy I assume. In real friendship, the
      judgment, the genius, the prudence of each party become the common
      property of both. Even if they are equals, they may not be so <i>always</i>.
      Those transient fits of passion, to which the best and wisest are liable,
      may deprive even the superior of the advantage of their reason. She then
      has still in her friend an <i>impartial</i>, though perhaps an inferior
      judgment; each becomes the guardian of the other, as their mutual safety
      may require.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heaven seems to have granted this double chance of virtue and happiness,
      as the peculiar reward of friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use it, then, my dear friend; accept the assistance you could so well
      return. Obey me; I shall judge of you by your resolution at this crisis:
      on it depends your fate, and my friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your sincere and affectionate CAROLINE.

    <p>
      <i>Just before she went to France</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time is now come, Lady V&mdash;&mdash;, when I must bid you an eternal
      adieu. With what deep regret, I need not, Julia, I cannot tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I burned your letter the moment I had read it. Your past confidence I
      never will betray; but I must renounce all future intercourse with you. I
      am a sister, a wife, a mother; all these connexions forbid me to be longer
      your friend. In misfortune, in sickness, or in poverty, I never would have
      forsaken you; but infamy I cannot share. I would have gone, I went, to the
      brink of the precipice to save you; with all my force I held you back; but
      in vain. But why do I vindicate my conduct to you now? Accustomed as I
      have always been to think your approbation necessary to my happiness, I
      forgot that henceforward your opinion is to be nothing to me, or mine to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, Julia! the idea, the certainty, that you must, if you live, be in a
      few years, in a few months, perhaps, reduced to absolute want, in a
      foreign country&mdash;without a friend&mdash;a protector, the fate of
      women who have fallen from a state as high as yours, the names of L&mdash;&mdash;,
      of G&mdash;&mdash;, the horror I feel at joining your name to theirs,
      impels me to make one more attempt to save you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Companion of my earliest years! friend of my youth! my beloved Julia! by
      the happy innocent hours we have spent together, by the love you had for
      me, by the respect you bear to the memory of your mother, by the agony
      with which your father will hear of the loss of his daughter, by all that
      has power to touch your mind&mdash;I conjure you, I implore you to pause!&mdash;Farewell!

      <i>Written a few months after the date of the preceding letter.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      My lord,
    </p>
    <p>
      Though I am too sensible that all connexion between my unfortunate friend
      and her family must for some time have been dissolved, I venture now to
      address myself to your lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Wednesday last, about half after six o&rsquo;clock in the evening, the
      following note was brought to me. It had been written with such a
      trembling hand that it was scarcely legible; but I knew the writing too
      well.

      &ldquo;If you ever loved me, Caroline, read this&mdash;do not tear it the moment
      you see the name of Julia: she has suffered&mdash;she is humbled. I left
      France with the hope of seeing you once more; but now I am so near you, my
      courage fails, and my heart sinks within me. I have no friend upon earth&mdash;I
      deserve none; yet I cannot help wishing to see, once more before I die,
      the friend of my youth, to thank her with my last breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, dear Caroline, if I must not see you, write to me, if possible, one
      line of consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, is my father living&mdash;do you know any thing of my children?&mdash;I
      dare not ask for my husband. Adieu! I am so weak that I can scarcely write&mdash;I
      hope I shall soon be no more. Farewell!
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;JULIA.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      I immediately determined to follow the bearer of this letter. Julia was
      waiting for my answer at a small inn in a neighbouring village, at a few
      miles&rsquo; distance. It was night when I got there: every thing was silent&mdash;all
      the houses were shut up, excepting one, in which we saw two or three
      lights glimmering through the window&mdash;this was the inn: as your
      lordship may imagine, it was a very miserable place. The mistress of the
      house seemed to be touched with pity for the stranger: she opened the door
      of a small room, where she said the poor lady was resting; and retired as
      I entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon a low matted seat beside the fire sat Lady V&mdash;&mdash;; she was
      in black; her knees were crossed, and her white but emaciated arms flung
      on one side over her lap; her hands were clasped together, and her eyes
      fixed upon the fire: she seemed neither to hear nor see any thing round
      her, but, totally absorbed in her own reflections, to have sunk into
      insensibility. I dreaded to rouse her from this state of torpor; and I
      believe I stood for some moments motionless: at last I moved softly
      towards her&mdash;she turned her head&mdash;started up&mdash;a scarlet
      blush overspread her face&mdash;she grew livid again instantly, gave a
      faint shriek, and sunk senseless into my arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she returned to herself, and found her head lying upon my shoulder,
      and heard my voice soothing her with all the expressions of kindness I
      could think of, she smiled with a look of gratitude, which I never shall
      forget. Like one who had been long unused to kindness, she seemed ready to
      pour forth all the fondness of her heart: but, as if recollecting herself
      better, she immediately checked her feelings&mdash;withdrew her hand from
      mine&mdash;thanked me&mdash;said she was quite well again&mdash;cast down
      her eyes, and her manner changed from tenderness to timidity. She seemed
      to think that she had lost all right to sympathy, and received even the
      common offices of humanity with surprise: her high spirit, I saw, was
      quite broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I never felt such sorrow as I did in contemplating Julia at this
      instant: she who stood before me, sinking under the sense of inferiority,
      I knew to be my equal&mdash;my superior; yet by fatal imprudence, by one
      rash step, all her great, and good, and amiable qualities were
      irretrievably lost to the world and to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I thought that she was a little recovered, I begged of her, if she
      was not too much fatigued, to let me carry her home. At these words she
      looked at me with surprise. Her eyes filled with tears; but without making
      any other reply, she suffered me to draw her arm within mine, and
      attempted to follow me. I did not know how feeble she was till she began
      to walk; it was with the utmost difficulty I supported her to the door;
      and by the assistance of the people of the house she was lifted into the
      carriage: we went very slowly. When the carriage stopped she was seized
      with an universal tremor; she started when the man knocked at the door,
      and seemed to dread its being opened. The appearance of light and the
      sound of cheerful voices struck her with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not myself help being shocked with the contrast between the
      dreadful situation of my friend, and the happiness of the family to which
      I was returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what are these voices?&mdash;Whither are you taking me?&mdash;For
      Heaven&rsquo;s sake do not let any body see me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assured her that she should go directly to her own apartment, and that
      no human being should approach her without her express permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! it happened at this very moment that all my children came running
      with the utmost gaiety into the hall to meet us, and the very circumstance
      which I had been so anxious to prevent happened&mdash;little Julia was
      amongst them. The gaiety of the children suddenly ceased the moment they
      saw Lady V&mdash;&mdash; coming up the steps&mdash;they were struck with
      her melancholy air and countenance: she, leaning upon my arm, with her
      eyes fixed upon the ground, let me lead her in, and sunk upon the first
      chair she came to. I made a sign to the children to retire; but the moment
      they began to move, Lady V&mdash;&mdash; looked up&mdash;saw her daughter&mdash;and
      now for the first time burst into tears The little girl did not recollect
      her poor mother till she heard the sound of her voice; and then she threw
      her arms round her neck, crying, &ldquo;Is it you, mamma?&rdquo;&mdash;and all the
      children immediately crowded round and asked, &ldquo;if this was the same Lady V&mdash;&mdash;
      who used to play with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to describe the effect these simple questions had on
      Julia: a variety of emotions seemed struggling in her countenance; she
      rose and made an attempt to break from the children, but could not&mdash;she
      had not strength to support herself. We carried her away and put her to
      bed; she took no notice of any body, nor did she even seem to know that I
      was with her: I thought she was insensible, but as I drew the curtains I
      heard her give a deep sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left her, and carried away her little girl, who had followed us up
      stairs and begged to stay with her mother; but I was apprehensive that the
      sight of her might renew her agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I was gone, they told me that she was perfectly still, with her eyes
      closed; and I stayed away some time in hopes that she might sleep:
      however, about midnight she sent to beg to speak to me: she was very ill&mdash;she
      beckoned to me to sit down by her bedside&mdash;every one left the room;
      and when Julia saw herself alone with me, she took my hand, and in a low
      but calm voice she said, &ldquo;I have not many hours to live&mdash;my heart is
      broken&mdash;I wished to see you, to thank you whilst it was yet in my
      power.&rdquo; She pressed my hand to her trembling lips: &ldquo;Your kindness,&rdquo; added
      she, &ldquo;touches me more than all the rest; but how ashamed you must be of
      such a friend! Oh, Caroline! to die a disgrace to all who ever loved me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears trickled down her face, and choked her utterance: she wiped them
      away hastily. &ldquo;But it is not now a time,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to think of myself&mdash;can
      I see my daughter?&rdquo; The little girl was asleep: she was awakened, and I
      brought her to her mother. Julia raised herself in her bed, and summoning
      up all her strength, &ldquo;My dearest friend!&rdquo; said she, putting her child&rsquo;s
      hand into mine, &ldquo;when I am gone, be a mother to this child&mdash;let her
      know my whole history, let nothing be concealed from her. Poor girl! you
      will live to blush at your mother&rsquo;s name.&rdquo; She paused and leaned back: I
      was going to take the child away, but she held out her arms again for her,
      and kissed her several times. &ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I shall never see you
      again.&rdquo; The little girl burst into tears. Julia wished to say something
      more&mdash;she raised herself again&mdash;at last she uttered these words
      with energy:&mdash;&ldquo;My love, <i>be good and happy</i>;&rdquo; she then sunk down
      on the pillow quite exhausted&mdash;she never spoke afterwards: I took her
      hand&mdash;it was cold&mdash;her pulse scarcely beat&mdash;her eyes rolled
      without meaning&mdash;in a few moments she expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Painful as it has been to me to recall the circumstances of her death to
      my imagination, I have given your lordship this exact and detailed account
      of my unfortunate friend&rsquo;s behaviour in her last moments. Whatever may
      have been her errors, her soul never became callous from vice. The sense
      of her own ill conduct, was undoubtedly the immediate cause of her
      illness, and the remorse which had long preyed upon her mind, at length
      brought her to the grave&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I have the honour to be, My lord, &amp;c. CAROLINE.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo;, WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
